Microbial diversity plays a crucial role in anaerobic digestion, influencing degradation efficiency and gas production. Methanogens, like Methanobacterium and Methanosarcina, are central to converting organic matter to methane. Acidogens, such as Clostridium, decompose complex waste into organic acids. Acetogens, including Acetobacterium, turn these acids into acetic acid, a methane precursor. Sulfate and nitrite reducers like Desulfovibrio and Paracoccus can decrease methane production. Denitrifiers, cellulolytic bacteria, and aromatic dehydrogenase microbes contribute to nitrogen removal, waste breakdown, and the digestion of hard-to-degrade organics. Nitrifying bacteria and yeast further influence the process. Balancing these microbial communities is essential for optimal anaerobic digestion outcomes.
