This study analysed recent literature, looking for the effect of process operating parameters (feed concentration, pH, temperature, and residence time) on the performance variables. Data from 551 experiments were analysed. Mean values of the SCOA concentration, yield, and productivity were 10 g l-1, 32% (chemical oxygen demand (COD) COD-1), and 1.9 g l-1 day-1, respectively. Feed concentration and residence time had the most important effect. Higher feed concentration corresponded to higher product concentration and productivity, but to lower yield. The mean feed concentration was 109 gCOD l-1 and 19 gCOD l-1 in the experiments with the highest product concentrations and in the experiments with the highest yields, respectively. Shorter residence times corresponded to higher productivity. The mean HRT (hydraulic residence time) in the experiments with the highest productivities was 2.5 days. Sequencing batch reactors gave higher values of the performance variables (mean values 29 g l-1, 41% COD COD-1, and 12 g l-1 day-1 for product concentration, yield, and productivity, respectively) than processes without phase separation."
1,"title:A Review of the Chemistry of Anaerobic Digestion: Methods of Accelerating and Optimizing Process Efficiency,abstract:The anaerobic digestion technology has been in existence for centuries and its underlying theory established for decades. It is considered a useful technology for the generation of renewable energy, and provides means to alleviate problems associated with low access to energy. However, a great deal of current research is targeted towards the optimization of this technology under diverse digestion process conditions. This review presents an in-depth analysis of the chemistry of anaerobic digestion and discusses how process chemistry can be used to optimize system performance through identification of methods that can accelerate syntrophic interactions of different microorganisms for improved methanogenic reactions. Recent advances in addition to old research are discussed in order to offer a general but comprehensive synopsis of accumulated knowledge in the theory of anaerobic digestion, as well as an overview of previous research and future directions and opportunities of the AD technology. Achieving a sustainable energy system requires comprehensive reforms in not just economic, social and policy aspects, but also in all technical aspects, which represents one of the most crucial future investments for anaerobic digestion systems."

3,"title:A Review of Pretreatment Methods to Enhance Solids Reduction during Anaerobic Digestion of Municipal Wastewater Sludges and the Resulting Digester Performance: Implications to Future Urban Biorefineries,abstract:The rapid increase in the population is expected to result in the approaching of design capacity for many US wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) over the next decade. WWTPs treat both municipal and industrial wastewater influents, resulting in the production of biosolids after digestion. Biogas, a potential recovered alternative energy source, is also produced as an output from successful anaerobic digestion. More than 7M of dry tons/year of biosolids produced in the US are most often disposed in either landfills or land-applied (~80%). These options are becoming more challenging to implement due to increases in transportation costs and tipping fees, decreases in the availability of landfill/landfarm space, and most importantly, increased regulations. This situation is strongly encouraging WWTPs to find alternatives for the disposal of biosolids. Developing alternative management/disposal options for biosolids are evolving. One of the most attractive alternative option from a sustainability perspective are biorefineries (converts waste to commercial products), which are a fast-growing option given the push toward circular urban source economies (little to no waste generation). Anaerobic digestion has been widely applied in WWTPs to reduce the volume of activated sludge due to its low energy requirements, effective handling of fluctuations due to organic loading rate, relative flexibility with temperature and pH changes, and since biogas is produced that can be transformed into energy. Various pretreatment methods for waste sludges prior to digestion that have been studied to reduce solids production and increase the energetic content of the biogas are presented and discussed. Solids handling and management, which comprises ~60% of the operational cost of a WWTP, is estimated to save more than $100 M annually by achieving at least 20% reduction in the annual production of biosolids within the US. This review incorporates an assessment of various pretreatment methods to optimize the anaerobic digestion of waste sludges with a focus on maximizing both biosolids reduction and biogas quality."

7,"title:Effect of Clinoptilolite and Halloysite Addition on Biogas Production and Microbial Community Structure during Anaerobic Digestion,abstract:The study presents a comparison of the influence of a clinoptilolite-rich rock—zeolite (commonly used for improving anaerobic digestion processes)—and a highly porous clay mineral, halloysite (mainly used for gas purification), on the biogas production process. Batch experiments showed that the addition of each mineral increased the efficiency of mesophilic anaerobic digestion of both sewage sludge and maize silage. However, halloysite generated 15% higher biogas production during maize silage transformation. Halloysite also contributed to a much higher reduction of chemical oxygen demand for both substrates (by ~8% for maize silage and ~14% for sewage sludge) and a higher reduction of volatile solids and total ammonia for maize silage (by ~8% and ~4%, respectively). Metagenomic analysis of the microbial community structure showed that the addition of both mineral sorbents influenced the presence of key members of archaea and bacteria occurring in a well-operated biogas reactor. The significant difference between zeolite and halloysite is that the latter promoted the immobilization of key methanogenic archaea Methanolinea (belong to Methanomicrobia class). Based on this result, we postulate that halloysite could be useful not only as a sorbent for (bio)gas treatment methodologies but also as an agent for improving biogas production."

10,"title:The Effects of Halogenated Compounds on the Anaerobic Digestion of Macroalgae,abstract:The urgent need to replace fossil fuels has seen macroalgae advancing as a potential feedstock for anaerobic digestion. The natural methane productivity (dry weight per hectare) of seaweeds is greater than in many terrestrial plant systems. As part of their defence systems, seaweeds, unlike terrestrial plants, produce a range of halogenated secondary metabolites, especially chlorinated and brominated compounds. Some orders of brown seaweeds also accumulate iodine, up to 1.2% of their dry weight. Fluorine remains rather unusual within the chemical structure. Halogenated hydrocarbons have moderate to high toxicities. In addition, halogenated organic compounds constitute a large group of environmental chemicals due to their extensive use in industry and agriculture. In recent years, concerns over the environmental fate and release of these halogenated organic compounds have resulted in research into their biodegradation and the evidence emerging shows that many of these compounds are more easily degraded under strictly anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic biodegradation. Biosorption via seaweed has become an alternative to the existing technologies in removing these pollutants. Halogenated compounds are known inhibitors of methane production from ruminants and humanmade anaerobic digesters. The focus of this paper is reviewing the available information on the effects of halogenated organic compounds on anaerobic digestion."
11,"title:Optimization of Reactor Temperature for Continuous Anaerobic Digestion of Cow Manure: Bangladesh Perspective,abstract:Converting organic waste into energy through anaerobic digestion is gaining popularity day by day. The reactor temperature is considered as one of the most vital factors for the digestion process. An experiment was conducted in the Biogas Laboratory of Green Energy Knowledge Hub at Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) to examine the influence of temperature on anaerobic digestion of cow-dung. Laboratory-scale continuous stirred tank reactors with a working volume of 15 L were operated for a 30-day retention time. The reactors were set at 20 C, 25 C, 30 C, 35 C, 40 C and 45 C, respectively to determine the effect of temperature on anaerobic digestion performance. Different parameters like total solids, volatile solids, pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen, biogas production rate and methane concentration were examined. Among all the reactors, the reactor at 40 C temperature produced maximum biogas (312.43 L/kg VS) and methane yields (209.70 L/kg VS), followed by the reactors at 35 C and 30 C, respectively. Statistical analysis of the obtained experimental results using Minitab® showed that the optimum process performance in terms of methane yield and volatile solid degradation is achieved at a reactor temperature of 35.82 C."
12,"title:Biogas Potential from the Anaerobic Digestion of Potato Peels: Process Performance and Kinetics Evaluation,abstract:This article intends to promote the usage of potato peels as efficient substrate for the anaerobic digestion process for energy recovery and waste abatement. This study examined the performance of anaerobic digestion of potato peels in different inoculum-to-substrate ratios. In addition, the impact of combined treatment with cow manure and pretreatment of potato peels was examined. It was found that co-digestion of potato peel waste and cow manure yielded up to 237.4 mL CH4/g VSadded, whereas the maximum methane yield from the mono-digestion of potato peels was 217.8 mL CH4/g VSadded. Comparing the co-digestion to mono-digestion of potato peels, co-digestion in PPW/CM ratio of 60:40 increased the methane yield by 10%. In addition, grinding and acid hydrolysis applied to potato peels were positively effective in increasing the methane amount reaching 260.3 and 283.4 mL CH4/g VSadded respectively. Likewise, compared to untreated potato peels, pretreatment led to an elevation of the methane amount by 9% and 17% respectively and alleviated the kinetics of biogas production."
13,"title:Rapid Two Stage Anaerobic Digestion of Nejayote through Microaeration and Direct Interspecies Electron Transfer,abstract:Corn is one of the main food products in Mexico. The elaboration of corn-derived products generates wastewater with a high organic load (nejayote). Anaerobic digestion is an indicated treatment for wastewater with high organic loads. The results of this study show that the application of microaeration in the hydrolysis-fermentative reactor increased the percentage of volatile fatty acids (VFA) available in the medium by 62%. The addition of a conductive material, such as granulated activated carbon (GAC), promotes DIET (Direct interspecies electrons transfer) in the methanogenic UASB reactor increasing the methane yield by 55%. Likewise, a great diversity of exoelectrogenic bacteria, with the ability to donate electrons DIET mechanisms, were developed in the GAC biofilm, though interestingly, Peptoclostridium and Clostridium (17.3% and 12.75%, respectively) were detected with a great abundance in the GAC biofilm. Peptoclostridium has not been previously reported as a participant in DIET process."
14,"title:Life Cycle Assessment of the Mesophilic, Thermophilic, and Temperature-Phased Anaerobic Digestion of Sewage Sludge,abstract:In this study the environmental impact of the anaerobic digestion (AD) of sewage sludge within an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was investigated. Three alternative AD systems (mesophilic, thermophilic, and temperature-phased anaerobic digestion (TPAD)) were compared to determine which system may have the best environmental performance. Two life cycle assessments (LCA) were performed considering: (i) the whole WWTP (for a functional unit (FU) of 1 m3 of treated wastewater), and (ii) the sludge line (SL) alone (for FU of 1 m3 of produced methane). The data for the LCA were obtained from previous laboratory experimental work in combination with full-scale WWTP and literature. According to the results, the WWTP with TPAD outperforms those with mesophilic and thermophilic AD in most analyzed impact categories (i.e., Human toxicity, Ionizing radiation, Metal and Fossil depletion, Agricultural land occupation, Terrestrial acidification, Freshwater eutrophication, and Ozone depletion), except for Climate change where the WWTP with mesophilic AD performed better than with TPAD by 7%. In the case of the SL alone, the production of heat and electricity (here accounted for as avoided environmental impacts) led to credits in most of the analyzed impact categories except for Human toxicity where credits did not balance out the impacts caused by the wastewater treatment system. The best AD alternative was thermophilic concerning all environmental impact categories, besides Climate change and Human toxicity. Differences between both LCA results may be attributed to the FU."

17,"title:Integrated Membrane Process for the Treatment and Reuse of Residual Table Olive Fermentation Brine and Anaerobically Digested Sludge Centrate,abstract:Management of wastewater is a major challenge nowadays, due to increasing water demand, growing population and more stringent regulations on water quality. Wastewaters from food conservation are especially difficult to treat, since they have high salinity and high organic matter concentration. The aim of this work is the treatment of the effluent from a table olive fermentation process (FTOP) with the aim of reusing it once the organic matter is separated. The process proposed in this work consists of the following membrane-based technologies: Ultrafiltration (UF) (UP005, Microdyn Nadir), Forward Osmosis (FO) (Osmen2521, Hydration Technology Innovation) and Nanofiltration (NF) (NF245, Dow). The FO process was implemented to reduce the salinity entering the NF process, using the FTOP as draw solution and, at the same time, to concentrate the centrate produced in the sludge treatment of a municipal wastewater treatment plant with the aim of obtaining a stream enriched in nutrients. The UF step achieved the elimination of 50% of the chemical oxygen demand of the FTOP. The UF permeate was pumped to the FO system reducing the volume of the anaerobically digested sludge centrate (ADSC) by a factor of 3 in 6.5 h. Finally, the ultrafiltrated FTOP diluted by FO was subjected to NF. The transmembrane pressure needed in the NF stage was 40% lower than that required if the ultrafiltration permeate was directly nanofiltered. By means of the integrated process, the concentration of organic matter and phenolic compounds in the FTOP decreased by 97%. Therefore, the proposed process was able to obtain a treated brine that could be reused in other processes and simultaneously to concentrate a stream, such as the ADSC."
18,"title:Semi-Continuous Anaerobic Digestion of Orange Peel Waste: Effect of Activated Carbon Addition and Alkaline Pretreatment on the Process,abstract:The valorization of orange peel waste (OPW) is sought worldwide mainly via anaerobic digestion. A common problem encountered during the biological treatment is the seasonality of its production and the presence of d-Limonene. The latter is a typical anti-microbial compound. This work aims to evaluate the effect of the use of granular activated carbon (GAC) combined with alkaline pretreatment to enhance methane generation during semi-continuous anaerobic digestion of OPW. The experimental design consisted of two groups of experiments, A and B. Experiment A was designed to verify the maximum OPW loading and to assess the effect of pH and nutrients on the process. Experiment B was designed to study the effect of alkaline pretreatment alone and of alkaline pretreatment aided by biochar addition to the process. Apart from the methane yields, the d-Limonene contents were measured in all experiments. The preliminary results showed that OPW alkaline pretreatment after the addition of a moderate amount of GAC can render anaerobic digestion of OPW sustainable as long as the organic loading does not exceed 2 gVSL-1day-1 and nutrients are supplemented. The experiment in which GAC was added after alkaline pretreatment resulted in the highest methane yield and reactor stability."

21,"title:Influences of Temperature and Substrate Particle Content on Granular Sludge Bed Anaerobic Digestion,abstract:Influences of temperature (25–35 C) and substrate particulate content (3.0–9.4 g total suspended solids (TSS)/L) on granular sludge bed anaerobic digestion (AD) were analyzed in lab-scale reactors using manure as a substrate and through modeling. Two particle levels were tested using raw (RF) and centrifuged (CF) swine manure slurries, fed into a 1.3-L lab-scale up-flow anaerobic sludge bed reactor (UASB) at temperatures of 25 C and 35 C. Biogas production increased with temperature in both high- and low-particle-content substrates; however, the temperature effect was stronger on high-particle-content substrate. RF and CF produced a comparable amount of biogas at 25 C, suggesting that biogas at this temperature came mainly from the digestion of small particles and soluble components present in similar quantities in both substrates. At 35 C, RF showed significantly higher biogas production than CF, which was attributed to increased (temperature-dependent) disintegration of larger solid particulates. Anaerobic Digestion Model No.1 (ADM1) based modeling was carried out by separating particulates into fast and slow disintegrating fractions and introducing temperature-dependent disintegration constants. Simulations gave a better fit for the experimental data than the conventional ADM1 model."
22,"title:Effect of Pasteurisation on Methane Yield from Food Waste and Other Substrates in Anaerobic Digestion,abstract:The effect of pasteurisation and co-pasteurisation on biochemical methane potential values in anaerobic digestion (AD) was studied. Pasteurisation prior to digestion in a biogas plant is a common hygienisation method for organic materials which contain or have been in contact with animal by-products. Tests were carried out on food waste, slaughterhouse waste, animal blood, cattle slurry, potato waste, card packaging and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW); pasteurisation at 70 C for 1 h was applied. Pasteurisation had increased the methane yields of blood (+15%) and potato waste (+12%) only, which both had a low content of structural carbohydrates (hemi-cellulose and cellulose) but a particularly high content of either non-structural carbohydrates such as starch (potato waste) or proteins (blood). With food waste, card packaging and cattle slurry, pasteurisation had no observable impact on the methane yield. Slaughterhouse waste and OFMSW yielded less methane after pasteurisation in the experiments (but statistical significance of the difference between pasteurised and unpasteurised slaughterhouse waste or OFMSW was not confirmed in this work). It is concluded that pasteurisation can positively impact the methane yield of some specific substrates, such as potato waste, where heat-treatment may induce gelatinisation with release of the starch molecules. For most substrates, however, pasteurisation at 70 C is unlikely to increase the methane yield. It is unlikely to improve biodegradability of lignified materials, and it may reduce the methane yield from substrates which contain high contents of volatile components. Furthermore, in this experimental study, the obtained methane yield was unaffected by whether the substrates were pasteurised individually and then co-digested or co-pasteurised as a mixture before batch digestion."

Hydrothermal pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass could enhance the process performance by increasing the generation of methane, hydrogen, and bioethanol. The recalcitrants (furfurals, and 5-HMF) could be formed at high temperatures during hydrothermal pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass, which may hinder the process performance. However, the detoxification process involving the use of genetically engineered microbes may be a promising option to reduce the toxic effects of inhibitors. The key challenge lies in the scaleup of the hydrothermal process, mainly due to necessity of upholding high temperature in sizeable reactors, which may demand high capital and operational costs. Thus, more efforts should be towards the techno-economic feasibility of hydrothermal pre-treatment at full scale."

The treatment of OFMSW via anaerobic digestion (AD) producing biogas is a process that is receiving a growing interest because two different needs can be coupled: the request of sustainable municipal waste treatments and increasing demand renewable energy. This paper aims to offer experimental results comparing batch test and continuous experimental reactors under different conditions of humidity and solid content. Results show that both the investigated configurations may be used for converting OFMSW into a high quality biogas and that the increase of dry matter in the continuous process still allows to achieve significant biogas production rates. A slight reduction of the methane content was observed (less than 5% relative) that can be also related to the change in the level of volatile fatty acids. These results are very promising in supporting the possibility of operating an industrial scale plant with a dry-process without affecting the system performance."
29,"title:Robust Data-Driven Soft Sensors for Online Monitoring of Volatile Fatty Acids in Anaerobic Digestion Processes,abstract:The concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) is one of the most important measurements for evaluating the performance of anaerobic digestion (AD) processes. In real-time applications, VFAs can be measured by dedicated sensors, which are still currently expensive and very sensitive to harsh environmental conditions. Moreover, sensors usually have a delay that is undesirable for real-time monitoring. Due to these problems, data-driven soft sensors are very attractive alternatives. This study proposes different data-driven methods for estimating reliable VFA values. We evaluated random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM) and genetic programming (GP) based on synthetic data obtained from the international water association (IWA) Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 (BSM2). The organic load to the AD in BSM2 was modified to simulate the behavior of an anaerobic co-digestion process. The prediction and generalization performances of the different models were also compared. This comparison showed that the GP soft sensor is more precise than the other soft sensors. In addition, the model robustness was assessed to determine the performance of each model under different process states. It is also shown that, in addition to their robustness, GP soft sensors are easy to implement and provide useful insights into the process by providing explicit equations."

However, wine lees are a complex substrate and may likely give rise to instabilities leading to failure of the biological process. This work analysed the digestion of wine lees using two different approaches. First, electro-oxidation was applied as pre-treatment using boron-doped diamond-based electrodes. The voltage was 25 V and different treatment times were tested (ranging from 0.08 to 1.5 h) at 25 C. Anaerobic digestion of wine lees was evaluated in batch tests to investigate the effect of electro-oxidation on biogas yield. Electro-oxidation exhibited a significant positive effect on biogas production increasing its value up to 330 L kg-1 of volatile solids after 1.5 h of treatment, compared to 180 L kg-1 of volatile solids measured from raw wine lees. As a second approach, the addition of biochar to the anaerobic digestion of wine lees was investigated; in the experimental conditions considered in the present study, the addition of biochar did not show any positive effect on anaerobic digestion performance."
34,"title:Improvement of Anaerobic Digestion of Hydrolysed Corncob Waste by Organosolv Pretreatment for Biogas Production,abstract:This paper describes an organosolv pretreatment of corncob waste to improve its anaerobic digestion for biogas production. Through a thermochemical process based on the use of ethanol and acetic acid, it was possible to separate the fractions of lignin, considered to be a natural inhibitor of anaerobic digestion processes. In addition, with this organosolv pretreatment, the available sugars in the carbohydrates present as monosaccharides, or simple sugars, were depolymerised, facilitating the digestion process. The obtained results include the chemical characterisation of the corncob, the hydrolysate, and the mixture with cow manure, finding that these substrates have potential to be used in anaerobic digestion. The total reducing sugars consumed were 96.8%, and total sugars were 85.75%. It was clearly observed that with the use of pretreatment with organosolv, the production of biogas was superior, because 484 NmL/gVS was obtained compared to the other reported treatments. It was also observed that adding the hydrolysate organosolv increased the production because the values of the control without hydrolysate were 120 NmL/gVS in the bottle experiment. When the experiment was scaled to the 5L reactor, the total volumes of biogas that were accumulated in 15 days of production were 5050 NmL/gVS and 1212 NmL/gVS with and without hydrolysate, respectively. This indicates that the organosolv pretreatment of corncob waste is effective in improving biogas production."

Regardless of the type of the used digestate (fertilizer, feedstock in case of solid-state fermentation, raw-material in case of thermal treatment) effective pathogen risk elimination, even in the case of high pathogen concentration is essential. An investigation of the survival time and inactivation rate of the Salmonella Senftenberg W775, Enterococcus spp., and Ascaris suum eggs during thermophilic anaerobic digestion performed on laboratory scale and confirmation of hygienization in full-scale operation were performed in this study. Except for sanitization efficiency, the AD process performance and stability were also verified based on determination of pH value, dry matter content, acidity, alkalinity, and content of fatty acids. The elimination of pathogen was met within 6.06 h, 5.5 h, and about 10 h for the Salmonella Senftenberg W775, Enterococcus spp., and Ascaris suum, respectively in the laboratory trials. The obtained results were confirmed in full-scale tests, using 1500 m3 Kompogas® reactors, operating in MBT Plant located in Poland. Sanitization of the digestate was achieved. Furthermore, the process was stable. The pH value, suspended solids, and ammonium content remained stable at 8.5, 35%, and 3.8 g/kg, respectively. The acetic acid content was noted between almost 0.8 and over 1.1 g/kg, while the concentration of propionic acid was noted at maximum level of about 100 mg/kg. The AD conditions could positively affect the pathogen elimination. Based on these results it can be found that anaerobic digestion under thermophilic conditions results in high sanitation efficiency."
41,"title:Influence of Granular Activated Carbon on Anaerobic Co-Digestion of Sugar Beet Pulp and Distillers Grains with Solubles,abstract:Anaerobic digestion is an important technology to receive energy from various types of biomass. In this work, the impact of granular activated carbon (GAC) on the mesophilic anaerobic co-digestion of sugar beet pulp and distillers grains was investigated. After a short period, anaerobic reactors began to produce biomethane and were ready for completion within 19–24 days. The addition of GAC to reactors (5–10 g L-1) significantly enhanced the methane production rate and consumption of produced volatile fatty acids. Thus, the maximum methane production rate increased by 13.7% in the presence of GAC (5 g L-1). Bacterial and archaeal community structure and dynamics were investigated, based on 16S rRNA genes analysis. The abundant classes of bacteria in GAC-free and GAC-containing reactors were Clostridia, Bacteroidia, Actinobacteria, and Synergistia. Methanogenic communities were mainly represented by the genera Methanosarcina, Methanoculleus, Methanothrix, and Methanomassiliicoccus in GAC-free and GAC-containing reactors. Our results indicate that the addition of granular activated carbon at appropriate dosages has a positive effect on anaerobic co-digestion of by-products of the processing of sugar beet and ethanol distillation process."

43,"title:Utilizing Anaerobic Digestates as Nutrient Solutions in Hydroponic Production Systems,abstract:Moving food production into the urban and peri-urban areas is one way of facilitating a closed-loop approach, integrating waste handling with food production in order to recirculate nutrients and at the same time reduce the use of mined and fossil resources in the production. Using anaerobic digestion as a way of converting urban wastes to an energy source (methane) and a nutrient-rich biodigestate with subsequent use as fertilizer for food production seems like a feasible approach. However, utilizing urban wastes in plant production systems implies some challenges, such as high salinity of the waste, imbalanced composition of nutrients, and abundance of less favorable forms of nitrogen. In a series of experiments, these problems were addressed. Vegetables (Pak Choi) were cultivated hydroponically in a controlled climate. Experiments included increased salinity, elevated levels of nitrite, and different concentrations of the biogas digestate-based nutrient solution, with mineral based solutions as controls. In general, the mineral controls yielded around 50% higher fresh biomass than the organic solutions. However, the quality of the produce with respect to content of secondary metabolites such as vitamins was enhanced when the plants were cultivated with organic nutrient solutions. Increasing the concentration of NaCl to 241 mg Cl L-1 did not negatively affect plant performance. Increasing the concentration of nitrite negatively affected plant growth, with reductions in biomass production by up to 50%. Given this well-functioning nitrification process that did not result in high nitrite concentrations, the use of anaerobic digestates seems feasible for hydroponic production of vegetables."

45,"title:Cadmium Addition Effects on Anaerobic Digestion with Elevated Temperatures,abstract:Anaerobic fermentation with biogas as an energy source is influenced by the presence of heavy metals. However, the availability of the heavy metals is dependent on the digestion temperature. In this study, the impacts of Cd on the characteristics of biogas, substrate biodegradation, and enzyme activity during anaerobic co-digestion were investigated under varying digestion temperatures. The results showed that 1 mg/L initial Cd concentration improved cumulative biogas yields by 404.96%, 16.93%, and 5.56% at 55 C, 45 C, and 35 C, respectively. In contrast, at low temperatures (25 C), the yield decreased by 0.77%. In the 55 C group, Cd addition improved the activity of cellulase (p < 0.05) and coenzyme F420 (p < 0.01). The total chemical oxygen demand (COD) during the peak period and the transformation of hydrolytic organic components into volatile fatty acids (VFAs) influenced the CH4 and biogas yields. There were no significant differences in cellulase, dehydrogenase, and coenzyme F420 activities with or without Cd addition when the digestion temperature was 45 C, 35 C, and 25 C. Therefore, thermophilic digestion is recommended for the efficient degradation of Cd-contaminated biowaste. Moreover, the impact of metals on the performance of anaerobic digestion should be considered together with temperature conditions in future research and practice."
46,"title:Environmental Assessment of Olive Mill Solid Waste Valorization via Anaerobic Digestion Versus Olive Pomace Oil Extraction,abstract:Anaerobic digestion is a promising alternative to valorize agrifood wastes, which is gaining interest under an environmental sustainability overview. The present research aimed to compare anaerobic digestion with olive pomace oil extraction, by using life cycle assessment, as alternatives for the valorization of the olive mill solid waste generated in the centrifugation process with a two-outlet decanter from oil mills. In the case of olive pomace oil extraction, two cases were defined depending on the type of fuel used for drying the wet pomace before the extraction: natural gas or a fraction of the generated extracted pomace. The anaerobic digestion alternative consisted of the production of biogas from the olive mill solid waste, heat and electricity cogeneration by the combustion of the generated biogas, and composting of the anaerobic digestate. The life cycle assessment showed that anaerobic digestion was the best alternative, with a global environmental impact reduction of 88.1 and 85.9% respect to crude olive pomace oil extraction using natural gas and extracted pomace, respectively, as fuel."
47,"title:On the Effect of Aqueous Ammonia Soaking Pre-Treatment on Continuous Anaerobic Digestion of Digested Swine Manure Fibers,abstract:(1) Background: The continuously increasing demand for renewable energy sources renders anaerobic digestion as one of the most promising technologies for renewable energy production. Due to the animal production intensification, manure is being used as the primary feedstock for most biogas plants. Their economical profitable operation, however, relies on increasing the methane yield from the solid fraction of manure, which is not so easily degradable. The solid fraction after anaerobic digestion, the so-called digested fibers, consists mainly of hardly biodegradable material and comes at a lower mass per unit volume of manure compared to the solid fraction before anaerobic digestion. Therefore, investigation on how to increase the biodegradability of digested fibers is very relevant. So far, Aqueous Ammonia Soaking (AAS), has been successfully applied on digested fibers separated from the effluent of a manure-fed, full-scale anaerobic digester to enhance their methane productivity in batch experiments. (2) Methods: In the present study, continuous experiments at a mesophilic (38 C) CSTR-type anaerobic digester fed with swine manure first and a mixture of manure with AAS-treated digested fibers in the sequel, were performed. Anaerobic Digestion Model 1 (ADM1) previously fitted on manure fed digester was used in order to assess the effect of the addition of AAS-pre-treated digested manure fibers on the kinetics of anaerobic digestion process. (3) Results and Conclusions: The methane yield of AAS-treated digested fibers under continuous operation was 49–68% higher than that calculated in batch experiments in the past. It was found that AAS treatment had a profound effect mainly on the disintegration/hydrolysis rate of particulate carbohydrates. Comparison of the data obtained in the present study with the data obtained with AAS-pre-treated raw manure fibers in the past revealed that hydrolysis kinetics after AAS pre-treatment were similar for both types of biomasses."
48,"title:Robust Data-Driven Soft Sensors for Online Monitoring of Volatile Fatty Acids in Anaerobic Digestion Processes,abstract:The concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) is one of the most important measurements for evaluating the performance of anaerobic digestion (AD) processes. In real-time applications, VFAs can be measured by dedicated sensors, which are still currently expensive and very sensitive to harsh environmental conditions. Moreover, sensors usually have a delay that is undesirable for real-time monitoring. Due to these problems, data-driven soft sensors are very attractive alternatives. This study proposes different data-driven methods for estimating reliable VFA values. We evaluated random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM) and genetic programming (GP) based on synthetic data obtained from the international water association (IWA) Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 (BSM2). The organic load to the AD in BSM2 was modified to simulate the behavior of an anaerobic co-digestion process. The prediction and generalization performances of the different models were also compared. This comparison showed that the GP soft sensor is more precise than the other soft sensors. In addition, the model robustness was assessed to determine the performance of each model under different process states. It is also shown that, in addition to their robustness, GP soft sensors are easy to implement and provide useful insights into the process by providing explicit equations."

50,"title:Performance and Microbial Community Dynamics in Anaerobic Digestion of Waste Activated Sludge: Impact of Immigration,abstract:Waste activated sludge (WAS) is a byproduct of municipal wastewater treatment. WAS contains a large proportion of inactive microbes, so when it is used as a substrate for anaerobic digestion (AD), their presence can interfere with monitoring of active microbial populations. To investigate how influent cells affect the active and inactive microbial communities during digestion of WAS, we operated model mesophilic bioreactors with conventional conditions. Under six different hydraulic retention times (HRTs; 25, 23, 20, 17, 14, and 11.5 d), the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and CH4 production of the AD were within a typical range for mesophilic sludge digesters. In the main bacteria were proteobacteria, bacteroidetes, and firmicutes in both the WAS and the bioreactors, while in main archaeal methanogen group was Methanosarcinales in the WAS and methanomicrobiales in the bioreactors. Of the 106 genera identified, the estimated net growth rates were negative in 72 and positive in 34. The genera with negative growth included many aerobic taxa. The genera with positive growth rates included methanogens and syntrophs. In some taxa, the net growth rate could be positive or negative, depending on HRT, so their abundance was also affected by HRT. This study gives insights into the microbial dynamics of a conventional sludge anaerobic digester by distinguishing potentially active (growing) and inactive (non-growing, dormant) microbes and by correlating population dynamics with process parameters."
51,"title:Improvement of Anaerobic Digestion of Hydrolysed Corncob Waste by Organosolv Pretreatment for Biogas Production,abstract:This paper describes an organosolv pretreatment of corncob waste to improve its anaerobic digestion for biogas production. Through a thermochemical process based on the use of ethanol and acetic acid, it was possible to separate the fractions of lignin, considered to be a natural inhibitor of anaerobic digestion processes. In addition, with this organosolv pretreatment, the available sugars in the carbohydrates present as monosaccharides, or simple sugars, were depolymerised, facilitating the digestion process. The obtained results include the chemical characterisation of the corncob, the hydrolysate, and the mixture with cow manure, finding that these substrates have potential to be used in anaerobic digestion. The total reducing sugars consumed were 96.8%, and total sugars were 85.75%. It was clearly observed that with the use of pretreatment with organosolv, the production of biogas was superior, because 484 NmL/gVS was obtained compared to the other reported treatments. It was also observed that adding the hydrolysate organosolv increased the production because the values of the control without hydrolysate were 120 NmL/gVS in the bottle experiment. When the experiment was scaled to the 5L reactor, the total volumes of biogas that were accumulated in 15 days of production were 5050 NmL/gVS and 1212 NmL/gVS with and without hydrolysate, respectively. This indicates that the organosolv pretreatment of corncob waste is effective in improving biogas production."

53,"title:Anaerobic Digestion of Steam-Exploded Wheat Straw and Co-Digestion Strategies for Enhanced Biogas Production,abstract:Wheat straw (WS) is considered a favourable substrate for biogas production. However, due to its rigid structure and high carbon to nitrogen (C/N ratio), its biodegradability during anaerobic digestion (AD) is usually low. In the present study, the effect of steam explosion pre-treatment on WS, combined with C/N adjustment with inorganic nitrogen, on biogas production was evaluated. Additionally, co-digestion of WS with protein-rich agri-industrial by-products (dried distillers’ grains with solubles (DDGS) and rapeseed meal (RM)) was assessed. Steam explosion enhanced biogas production from WS, whereas the addition of NH4Cl was beneficial (p < 0.05) for the digestion of steam-exploded wheat straw (SE). Furthermore, mono-digestion of the four different substrates seemed to be efficient in both inoculum to substrate ratios (I/S) tested (3.5 and 1.75 (w/w)). Finally, during co-digestion of WS and SE with DDGS and RM, an increase in the cumulative methane production was noted when higher amounts of DDGS and RM were co-digested. This study demonstrated that DDGS and RM can be used as an AD supplement to stimulate gas production and improve wheat straw biodegradability, while their addition at 10% on an AD system operating with WS can enhance gas yields at levels similar to those achieved by steam-exploded straw."
54,"title:Product Concentration, Yield and Productivity in Anaerobic Digestion to Produce Short Chain Organic Acids: A Critical Analysis of Literature Data,abstract:In order to make anaerobic digestion-based processes for short chain organic acid (SCOA) production attractive, the key performance variables, i.e., concentration, yield, and productivity of the produced SCOAs need to be maximised. This study analysed recent literature, looking for the effect of process operating parameters (feed concentration, pH, temperature, and residence time) on the performance variables. Data from 551 experiments were analysed. Mean values of the SCOA concentration, yield, and productivity were 10 g l-1, 32% (chemical oxygen demand (COD) COD-1), and 1.9 g l-1 day-1, respectively. Feed concentration and residence time had the most important effect. Higher feed concentration corresponded to higher product concentration and productivity, but to lower yield. The mean feed concentration was 109 gCOD l-1 and 19 gCOD l-1 in the experiments with the highest product concentrations and in the experiments with the highest yields, respectively. Shorter residence times corresponded to higher productivity. The mean HRT (hydraulic residence time) in the experiments with the highest productivities was 2.5 days. Sequencing batch reactors gave higher values of the performance variables (mean values 29 g l-1, 41% COD COD-1, and 12 g l-1 day-1 for product concentration, yield, and productivity, respectively) than processes without phase separation."

56,"title:Effects of Increasing Nitrogen Content on Process Stability and Reactor Performance in Anaerobic Digestion,abstract:The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of different nitrogen increase rates in feedstock on the process stability and conversion efficiency in anaerobic digestion (AD). The research was conducted in continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTR), initially filled with two different inocula: inocula #1 with low and #2 with high nitrogen (N) concentrations. Three N feeding regimes were investigated: the “0-increase” feeding regime with a constant N amount in feeding and the regimes “0.25-increase” and “0.5-increase” where the N concentrations in feedstock were raised by 0.25 and 0.5 gkg-1, respectively, related to fresh matter (FM) every second week. The N concentration inside the reactors increased according to the feeding regimes. The levels of inhibition (Inhibition) in specific methane yields (SMY), related to the conversion efficiency of the substrates, were quantified. At the N concentration in digestate of 10.82  0.52 gkg-1 FM measured in the reactors with inoculum #2 and “0.5-increase” feeding regime, the level of inhibition was equal to 38.99%  14.99%. The results show that high nitrogen increase rates in feeding regime are negatively related to the efficiency of the AD process, even if low volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations indicate a stable process."
57,"title:Interactive Effects of Chemical Composition of Food Waste during Anaerobic Co-Digestion under Thermophilic Temperature,abstract:The effects of chemical composition (carbohydrates, lipids, and protein) on the anaerobic co-digestion performance of food wastes (FW) were investigated from the viewpoints of methane production, dynamic parameters, and microbial community structure. The results of this study showed that a notable gasification rate was positively correlated with the proportion of the composition. A T2 reactor, which consisted of 60% carbohydrates, 20% lipids, and 20% protein, held a higher gasification rate of 65.09% compared to other groups, while its process parameters showed some deficiency regarding the stability of digestion, especially for low biochemical methane potential (BMP), which was not beneficial for the actual practice. A T4 reactor, with a highest gasification rate of 70.68%, held the maximum BMP (497.44 mL/g VS). The stable chemical parameters achieved the optimal proportion, consisting of 40% carbohydrates, 40% lipids, and 20% protein. Furthermore, its microbial populations were rich and achieved a balance of the two main dominant communities of acetoclastic methanogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, whose relative abundance was close. It was obvious that interactive effects were caused by different proportional composition, which led to constantly changing chemical parameters and microbial community."

Biogas from the SSAD of dairy cattle manure, and the digestate of SSAD was fed to BSFL. In turn, BSFL can be fed to animals as a protein supplement. Adjustment of the pH and 30% inoculation ratio (IR30) during SSAD produced the highest theoretical methane yield, 626.1  28.7 L CH4/kg VSdes, with an ultimate methane yield of 96.81  2.0 L CH4/kg VSload. For BSFL composting, the groups with a feeding rate of 75 and 100 mg/day/larvae had the highest body weight change, which was 969.6  28.4% and 984.1  177.6%, respectively. The combination process of SSAD and BSFL composting increases the incentive for dairy cattle manure treatment instead of conventional composting and produced more valuable products."

Tests were carried out in reactors with full mixing. Biogas production was higher in thermophilic conditions than in mesophilic conditions (0.92 L/g volatile solids at 55 C vs. 0.42 L/g volatile solids at 37 C, respectively). The resulting methane yields were 0.25-0.32 L CH4/g VS and 0.56–0.70 L CH4/g VS in mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, respectively. In both variants, the methane share was over 70% v/v. This work also discusses the potential impact of Maillard compounds on the efficiency of the fermentation process, which were probably produced during the process of autoclaving of municipal waste. These results indicate that, after autoclaving, the organic fraction of municipal waste can be an effective substrate for anaerobic digestion in thermophilic conditions."

Through global chemical profiling, the chemical characteristics of different digestates and types of manure were displayed during the anaerobic digestion (AD) process. As the feed for AD, CM had less easily-degradable organics, SM contained the least O-alkyls and anomerics of carbohydrates, and CHM exhibited relatively lower bio-stability. The derived metabolite pathways of different manure during the AD process were identified by MetaboAnalyst. Twelve, 8, and 5 metabolic pathways were affected by the AD process in CHM, SM, and CM, respectively. Furthermore, bioactive compounds of digestate were detected, such as amino acids (L-arginine, L-ornithine, L-cysteine, and L-aspartate), hormones (L-adrenaline, 19-hydroxy androstenedione, and estrone), alkaloids (tryptamine and N-methyltyramine), and vitamin B5, in different types of manure and their digestates.

The treatment of OFMSW via anaerobic digestion (AD) producing biogas is a process that is receiving a growing interest because two different needs can be coupled: the request of sustainable municipal waste treatments and increasing demand renewable energy. This paper aims to offer experimental results comparing batch test and continuous experimental reactors under different conditions of humidity and solid content. Results show that both the investigated configurations may be used for converting OFMSW into a high quality biogas and that the increase of dry matter in the continuous process still allows to achieve significant biogas production rates. A slight reduction of the methane content was observed (less than 5% relative) that can be also related to the change in the level of volatile fatty acids. These results are very promising in supporting the possibility of operating an industrial scale plant with a dry-process without affecting the system performance."

At the same time, an obvious decrease of propionic acid was observed after EDTA-Ni addition. The speciation analysis of Ni showed that the percentages of water-soluble and exchangeable Ni were increased to 38.8% and 36.3% due to EDTA-Ni addition, respectively. Also, the high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the EDTA-Ni promoted the growth and metabolism of Methanosarcina and Methanobacterium, which might be the major reason for propionic acid degradation and methane production."

This study is aimed at designing and analyzing two scenarios for bioenergy production from undervalued biomass (sawdust). In one of the scenarios (direct combustion or DC), raw biomass is burned in a combustor to provide the heat that is required by the Rankine cycle to generate electricity. In the other scenario (HTC-AD), the raw biomass first undergoes HTC treatment. While the solid product (hydrochar) is used to produce power by a Rankine cycle, the liquid by-product undergoes an AD process. This results in fuel gas production and it can be used in a Brayton cycle to generate more power. Energy and mass balance analysis of both scenarios were developed for each unit process by using Engineering Equation Solver (EES). The required data were obtained experimentally or from the literature. The performances of the proposed systems were evaluated, and a sensitivity analysis was presented to help in finding the best operational conditions."

VFA fermentation after different inoculum treatments was studied in batch scale using urban biowaste as the substrate and the process performance was assessed with chemical and microbial analyses. Inoculum treatments, especially thermal treatment, were shown to increase VFA yields, which were also correlating with the dynamics of the microbial communities and retention times of the test. There was a strong correlation between VFA production and the relative abundances of the microbial orders Clostridiales (families Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Clostridiaceae), and Lactobacillales. A syntrophic relationship of these taxa with members of the Methanobacteriales order was also presumed."

The industry produces significant quantities of organic-rich wastewater which requires treatment prior to release to the environment. Anaerobic lagoons are a cost-effective method of waste treatment where land availability is not an issue; however, the high fat load in the wastewater can negatively impact the anaerobic lagoon system and result in compromised anaerobic digestion performance. This paper will discuss the importance of upstream primary pre-treatment and review a series of investigations focused on optimising digester performance and improving fat biodegradability. These studies include: 1. the effect of temperature and mixing; 2. the influence of feedstock trace element composition and supplementation, and; 3. the potential benefit from pre-treatments such as chemical, thermobaric, thermochemical and bio-surfactant. This paper discusses the implications of these findings for covered anaerobic lagoon operation and provides recommendations to promote optimum digester performance and future opportunities in adopting alternate anaerobic digestion technology options. Finally, the paper provides recent trends toward the use of other waste streams for co-digestion and discusses this in terms of digester optimization and technology options."

Growth on AD effluent is often limited due to substrate limitation or inhibitory compounds. This study demonstrates the successful cultivation of Synechococcus on minimally amended AD effluent, supplemented with MgSO4 and diluted with seawater. An 8 L airlift reactor illustrated growth in a pilot scale setup. Higher biomass yields were observed for cyanobacteria grown in diluted AD effluent compared to minimal medium, with 60% total nitrogen removal in the effluent. It was demonstrated that controlling the pH, increasing dissolved salt concentrations and adding MgSO4 to the effluent allowed for the successful cultivation of the cyanobacterium, circumventing the addition of clean water for effluent dilution. This could ultimately increase the feasibility of anaerobic digestion-microalgae integrated biorefineries."
80,"title:Mesophilic Semi-Continuous Anaerobic Digestion of Strawberry Extrudate Pretreated with Steam Explosion,abstract:The production of strawberry concentrate produces a side stream after extrusion that is commonly landfilled. This strawberry extrudate (SE), of lignocellulosic character, contains valuable bioactive compounds such as sugars and phenols. Thermal treatments, such as steam explosion, are currently used for the valorisation of agricultural lignocellulosic wastes due to their ability to impact the structure of the lignocellulose and hemicellulose present in these wastes, favouring the disruption of fibrous material. Steam explosion has already been shown as a promising technology for phenol recovery from SE. Biogas is an additional valuable resource that might be produced from thermally pretreated and de-phenolised SE. This study assessed the influence of a steam-explosion pretreatment and the subsequent recovery of phenolic compounds from the long-term operation of a semi-continuous anaerobic digester of pretreated SE. The anaerobic digestion of SE steam exploded at 220 C for 5 min and de-phenolised was stable at an OLR of 0.5 g of volatile solids (VS)/(Ld), which permitted a specific production rate of 135  11 mL of CH4/(g of VS d). The system was not able to operate at an OLR of 1 g of VS/(Ld), which resulted in a failure of the process. Despite the inhibition threshold of phenolic compounds not being achieved, the inhibition of the anaerobic digestion process at an OLR of 1 g of VS/(Ld) was most likely due to the overloading of the system. This was indicated by the accumulation of soluble organic matter and volatile fatty acids. The increase in the propionic acid concentration up to 1300 mg/L when operating at OLRs higher than 0.5 g of VS/(Ld) could be the main factor responsible for the inhibition. An economic evaluation showed that the proposed approach (steam explosion, phenol recovery, and anaerobic digestion) would offer positive benefits, taking into account the high phenolic recovery (0.90 g of gallic acid equivalents/kg of extrudate) and the low sales price of the phenol extract, i.e., EUR 0.610/g of gallic acid equivalents, needed to reach zero net profit."

82,"title:A Brief Review of Anaerobic Digestion of Algae for Bioenergy,abstract:The potential of algal biomass as a source of liquid and gaseous biofuels has been the subject of considerable research over the past few decades, with researchers strongly agreeing that algae have the potential of becoming a viable aquatic energy crop with a higher energy potential compared to that from either terrestrial biomass or municipal solid waste. However, neither microalgae nor seaweed are currently cultivated solely for energy purposes due to the high costs of harvesting, concentrating and drying. Anaerobic digestion of algal biomass could theoretically reduce costs associated with drying wet biomass before processing, but practical yields of biogas from digestion of many algae are substantially below the theoretical maximum. New processing methods are needed to reduce costs and increase the net energy balance. This review examines the biochemical and structural properties of seaweeds and of microalgal biomass that has been produced as part of the treatment of wastewater, and discusses some of the significant hurdles and recent initiatives for producing biogas from their anaerobic digestion."

86,"title:Enhanced Anaerobic Digestion by Stimulating DIET Reaction,abstract:Since the observation of direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) in anaerobic mixed cultures in 2010s, the topic “DIET-stimulation” has been the main route to enhance the performance of anaerobic digestion (AD) under harsh conditions, such as high organic loading rate (OLR) and the toxicants’ presence. In this review article, we tried to answer three main questions: (i) What are the merits and strategies for DIET stimulation? (ii) What are the consequences of stimulation? (iii) What is the mechanism of action behind the impact of this stimulation? Therefore, we introduced DIET history and recent relevant findings with a focus on the theoretical advantages. Then, we reviewed the most recent articles by categorizing how DIET reaction was stimulated by adding conductive material (CM) and/or applying external voltage (EV). The emphasis was made on the enhanced performance (yield and/or production rate), CM type, applied EV, and mechanism of action for each stimulation strategy. In addition, we explained DIET-caused changes in microbial community structure. Finally, future perspectives and practical limitations/chances were explored in detail. We expect this review article will provide a better understanding for DIET pathway in AD and encourage further research development in a right direction."
87,"title:Long-Term Evaluation of Mesophilic Semi-Continuous Anaerobic Digestion of Olive Mill Solid Waste Pretreated with Steam-Explosion,abstract:Steam-explosion is a promising technology for recovering phenolic compounds from olive mill solid waste (OMSW) due to its high impact on the structure of the fibre. Moreover, the recovery of the phenols, which are well-known microbial inhibitors, could improve the subsequent biomethanization of the dephenolized OMSW to produce energy. However, there is a considerable lack of knowledge about how the remaining phenolic compounds could affect a long-term biomethanization process of steam-exploded OMSW. This work evaluated a semi-continuous mesophilic anaerobic digestion of dephenolized steam-exploited OMSW during a long operational period (275 days), assessing different organic loading rates (OLRs). The process was stable at an OLR of 1 gVS/(Ld), with a specific production rate of 163  28 mL CH4/(gVSd). However, the increment of the OLR up to 2 gVS/(Ld) resulted in total exhaust of the methane production. The increment in the propionic acid concentration up to 1486 mg/L could be the main responsible factor for the inhibition. Regardless of the OLR, the concentration of phenolic compounds was always lower than the inhibition limits. Therefore, steam-exploited OMSW could be a suitable substrate for anaerobic digestion at a suitable OLR."
88,"title:Improvement of Anaerobic Digestion of Lignocellulosic Biomass by Hydrothermal Pretreatment,abstract:Lignocellulosic biomass, comprising of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, is a difficult- to-degrade substrate when subjected to anaerobic digestion. Hydrothermal pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass could enhance the process performance by increasing the generation of methane, hydrogen, and bioethanol. The recalcitrants (furfurals, and 5-HMF) could be formed at high temperatures during hydrothermal pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass, which may hinder the process performance. However, the detoxification process involving the use of genetically engineered microbes may be a promising option to reduce the toxic effects of inhibitors. The key challenge lies in the scaleup of the hydrothermal process, mainly due to necessity of upholding high temperature in sizeable reactors, which may demand high capital and operational costs. Thus, more efforts should be towards the techno-economic feasibility of hydrothermal pre-treatment at full scale."
89,"title:Adjusting Organic Load as a Strategy to Direct Single-Stage Food Waste Fermentation from Anaerobic Digestion to Chain Elongation,abstract:Production of medium chain carboxylic acids (MCCA) as renewable feedstock bio-chemicals, from food waste (FW), requires complicated reactor configurations and supplementation of chemicals to achieve product selectivity. This study evaluated the manipulation of organic loading rate in an un-supplemented, single stage stirred tank reactor to steer an anaerobic digestion (AD) microbiome towards acidogenic fermentation (AF), and thence to chain elongation. Increasing substrate availability by switching to a FW feedstock with a higher COD stimulated chain elongation. The MCCA species n-caproic (10.1  1.7 g L-1) and n-caprylic (2.9  0.8 g L-1) acid were produced at concentrations comparable to more complex reactor set-ups. As a result, of the adjusted operating strategy, a more specialised microbiome developed containing several MCCA-producing bacteria, lactic acid-producing Olsenella spp. and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. By contrast, in an AD reactor that was operated in parallel to produce biogas, the retention times had to be doubled when fed with the high-COD FW to maintain biogas production. The AD microbiome comprised a diverse mixture of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria, and acetoclastic methanogens. The results suggest that manipulation of organic loading rate and food-to-microorganism ratio may be used as an operating strategy to direct an AD microbiome towards AF, and to stimulate chain elongation in FW fermentation, using a simple, un-supplemented stirred tank set-up. This outcome provides the opportunity to repurpose existing AD assets operating on food waste for biogas production, to produce potentially higher value MCCA products, via simple manipulation of the feeding strategy."

98,"title:Utilizing Anaerobic Digestates as Nutrient Solutions in Hydroponic Production Systems,abstract:Moving food production into the urban and peri-urban areas is one way of facilitating a closed-loop approach, integrating waste handling with food production in order to recirculate nutrients and at the same time reduce the use of mined and fossil resources in the production. Using anaerobic digestion as a way of converting urban wastes to an energy source (methane) and a nutrient-rich biodigestate with subsequent use as fertilizer for food production seems like a feasible approach. However, utilizing urban wastes in plant production systems implies some challenges, such as high salinity of the waste, imbalanced composition of nutrients, and abundance of less favorable forms of nitrogen. In a series of experiments, these problems were addressed. Vegetables (Pak Choi) were cultivated hydroponically in a controlled climate. Experiments included increased salinity, elevated levels of nitrite, and different concentrations of the biogas digestate-based nutrient solution, with mineral based solutions as controls. In general, the mineral controls yielded around 50% higher fresh biomass than the organic solutions. However, the quality of the produce with respect to content of secondary metabolites such as vitamins was enhanced when the plants were cultivated with organic nutrient solutions. Increasing the concentration of NaCl to 241 mg Cl L-1 did not negatively affect plant performance. Increasing the concentration of nitrite negatively affected plant growth, with reductions in biomass production by up to 50%. Given this well-functioning nitrification process that did not result in high nitrite concentrations, the use of anaerobic digestates seems feasible for hydroponic production of vegetables."
99,"title:Biogas Potential from the Anaerobic Digestion of Potato Peels: Process Performance and Kinetics Evaluation,abstract:This article intends to promote the usage of potato peels as efficient substrate for the anaerobic digestion process for energy recovery and waste abatement. This study examined the performance of anaerobic digestion of potato peels in different inoculum-to-substrate ratios. In addition, the impact of combined treatment with cow manure and pretreatment of potato peels was examined. It was found that co-digestion of potato peel waste and cow manure yielded up to 237.4 mL CH4/g VSadded, whereas the maximum methane yield from the mono-digestion of potato peels was 217.8 mL CH4/g VSadded. Comparing the co-digestion to mono-digestion of potato peels, co-digestion in PPW/CM ratio of 60:40 increased the methane yield by 10%. In addition, grinding and acid hydrolysis applied to potato peels were positively effective in increasing the methane amount reaching 260.3 and 283.4 mL CH4/g VSadded respectively. Likewise, compared to untreated potato peels, pretreatment led to an elevation of the methane amount by 9% and 17% respectively and alleviated the kinetics of biogas production."
100,"title:Effects of Increasing Nitrogen Content on Process Stability and Reactor Performance in Anaerobic Digestion,abstract:The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of different nitrogen increase rates in feedstock on the process stability and conversion efficiency in anaerobic digestion (AD). The research was conducted in continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTR), initially filled with two different inocula: inocula #1 with low and #2 with high nitrogen (N) concentrations. Three N feeding regimes were investigated: the “0-increase” feeding regime with a constant N amount in feeding and the regimes “0.25-increase” and “0.5-increase” where the N concentrations in feedstock were raised by 0.25 and 0.5 gkg-1, respectively, related to fresh matter (FM) every second week. The N concentration inside the reactors increased according to the feeding regimes. The levels of inhibition (Inhibition) in specific methane yields (SMY), related to the conversion efficiency of the substrates, were quantified. At the N concentration in digestate of 10.82  0.52 gkg-1 FM measured in the reactors with inoculum #2 and “0.5-increase” feeding regime, the level of inhibition was equal to 38.99%  14.99%. The results show that high nitrogen increase rates in feeding regime are negatively related to the efficiency of the AD process, even if low volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations indicate a stable process."

103,"title:Improvement of Waste Dehydrated Sludge for Anaerobic Digestion through High-Temperature and High-Pressure Solubilization,abstract:Biochemical methane potential tests and lab-scale continuous experiments were conducted to improve the yield and energy efficiency of anaerobic digestion through thermal hydrolysis pre-treatment. Methane generation, yield, and solubilization efficiency were evaluated through lab-scale tests. The pre-treated samples presented 50% biodegradability at 140 C and 61.5% biodegradability at 165 C. The increase in biodegradability was insignificant at 165 C or higher temperature, and it was confirmed that the optimum conditions were achieved at 165 C and 20 min of solubilization. The lab-scale continuous experiments confirmed that polymers were decomposed into low-molecular-weight compounds due to thermal hydrolysis, and pH decreased. NH4HCO3 produced by thermal hydrolysis acted as an alkali to enable a more stable operation compared to that before thermal hydrolysis. Total chemical oxygen demand as chromium (TCODCr) and soluble chemical oxygen demand as chromium (SCODCr) indicated 35.4% and 23.1% removal efficiency in terms of organic matter removal, respectively. Methane yield was approximately 0.35 kg m-3 at 2.0–4.0 kg (m3 d)-1 and 0.26 kg m-3 at 5.0 kg (m3 d)-1. The solubilization rate of 40.9% by thermal hydrolysis was confirmed through the lab-scale tests to determine its full-scale applicability."

105,"title:Pathogen Reduction Potential in Anaerobic Digestion of Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste and Food Waste,abstract:Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a commonly used method of processing waste. Regardless of the type of the used digestate (fertilizer, feedstock in case of solid-state fermentation, raw-material in case of thermal treatment) effective pathogen risk elimination, even in the case of high pathogen concentration is essential. An investigation of the survival time and inactivation rate of the Salmonella Senftenberg W775, Enterococcus spp., and Ascaris suum eggs during thermophilic anaerobic digestion performed on laboratory scale and confirmation of hygienization in full-scale operation were performed in this study. Except for sanitization efficiency, the AD process performance and stability were also verified based on determination of pH value, dry matter content, acidity, alkalinity, and content of fatty acids. The elimination of pathogen was met within 6.06 h, 5.5 h, and about 10 h for the Salmonella Senftenberg W775, Enterococcus spp., and Ascaris suum, respectively in the laboratory trials. The obtained results were confirmed in full-scale tests, using 1500 m3 Kompogas® reactors, operating in MBT Plant located in Poland. Sanitization of the digestate was achieved. Furthermore, the process was stable. The pH value, suspended solids, and ammonium content remained stable at 8.5, 35%, and 3.8 g/kg, respectively. The acetic acid content was noted between almost 0.8 and over 1.1 g/kg, while the concentration of propionic acid was noted at maximum level of about 100 mg/kg. The AD conditions could positively affect the pathogen elimination. Based on these results it can be found that anaerobic digestion under thermophilic conditions results in high sanitation efficiency."

The present study deals with the electro-Fenton (EF) pretreatment for enhancing the WAS biogas potential with low-cost iron electrodes. The effect of pretreatment on the physicochemical characteristics of sludge was assessed. Following EF pretreatment, the pH, conductivity, soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), and volatile fatty acids (VFA) increased to 7.5, 13.72 mS/cm, 4.1 g/L, and 925 mg/L, respectively. Capillary suction time (CST) analysis highlighted the dewaterability effect of EF on WAS, as demonstrated by the decrease in CST from 429 to 180 s following 30 min of pretreatment. Batch digestion assays presented an increase in the biogas yield to 0.135 L/g volatile solids (VS) after 60 min of EF pretreatment in comparison to raw sludge (0.08 L/g VS). Production of biogas was also found to improve during semi-continuous fermentation of EF-pretreated sludge conducted in a lab-scale reactor. In comparison to raw sludge, EF-pretreated sludge produced the highest biogas yield (0.81 L biogas/g VS) with a high COD removal rate, reaching 96.6% at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 2.5 g VS/L. d.

The study of growth kinetics of the biochemical methane potential test revealed that a maximum of 36% increase in methane yield was observed from co-digestion of a substrate pretreated by thermophilic aerobic conditions (55 C and HRT = 2 days) and an 8.3% increase was obtained from the anaerobic pretreated substrate (55 C and HRT = 3 days). Moreover, no synergistic effects on methane yields were observed in co-digesting the substrate pretreated with high temperature (85 C). The study also identified specific conditions in which interaction between biological pretreatment and co-digestion might substantially reduce methane yield. Careful optimization of operating conditions, both aerobic and anaerobic pretreatment at moderate thermophilic conditions, can be used as a biological pretreatment to enhance methane yield from the co-digestion of microalgae and primary sludge."

109,"title:Dry Anaerobic Digestion of Chicken Manure: A Review,abstract:Providing anaerobic digestion is a prospective technology for utilizing organic waste, however, for waste with a high content of nitrogen such as manure, dilution is necessary to decrease the ammonia inhibition effect which leads to the production of a huge effluent amount which is difficult to use. Dry anaerobic digestion has some advantages such as reduced reactor volume, higher volumetric methane yield, lower energy consumption for heating, less wastewater production, and lower logistic costs for fertilizers. These factors generate interest in using it for treatment of even high-nitrogen substrates. The purpose of this work was to analyze different dry anaerobic digestion technologies, the features of dry anaerobic digestion, laboratory studies on chicken manure dry anaerobic digestion, and methods of reducing inhibitors’ effects. Nowadays, there are no dry anaerobic industrial plants working on chicken manure. However, studies on dry anaerobic digestion of chicken manure have proven the possibility of methane production under fermentation of chicken manure with high total solids content, but the process has been described as being unstable. Co-fermentation, ammonium/ammonia removal, and adaptation of the microbial consortium have been used to decrease the effect of ammonia inhibition. A prospective way for ammonia concentration control is absorption using a non-volatile sorbent located in the reactor. It decreases ammonia content during wet anaerobic digestion by 33% and it is characterized by having a positive economic effect. Therefore, dry anaerobic fermentation of chicken manure is possible, but there is still no efficient way to provide it. The results of this article should be helpful in the selection of anaerobic digestion technology for treating chicken manure."

111,"title:Cadmium Addition Effects on Anaerobic Digestion with Elevated Temperatures,abstract:Anaerobic fermentation with biogas as an energy source is influenced by the presence of heavy metals. However, the availability of the heavy metals is dependent on the digestion temperature. In this study, the impacts of Cd on the characteristics of biogas, substrate biodegradation, and enzyme activity during anaerobic co-digestion were investigated under varying digestion temperatures. The results showed that 1 mg/L initial Cd concentration improved cumulative biogas yields by 404.96%, 16.93%, and 5.56% at 55 C, 45 C, and 35 C, respectively. In contrast, at low temperatures (25 C), the yield decreased by 0.77%. In the 55 C group, Cd addition improved the activity of cellulase (p < 0.05) and coenzyme F420 (p < 0.01). The total chemical oxygen demand (COD) during the peak period and the transformation of hydrolytic organic components into volatile fatty acids (VFAs) influenced the CH4 and biogas yields. There were no significant differences in cellulase, dehydrogenase, and coenzyme F420 activities with or without Cd addition when the digestion temperature was 45 C, 35 C, and 25 C. Therefore, thermophilic digestion is recommended for the efficient degradation of Cd-contaminated biowaste. Moreover, the impact of metals on the performance of anaerobic digestion should be considered together with temperature conditions in future research and practice."

Therefore, this study is focused on the evaluation of biogas and bio-methane yield from the co-digestion of three available and abundant bio-wastes in the southern regions of Tunisia. The three different raw materials are an organic fraction of municipal solid waste, chicken manure, and olive mill wastewater.

Anaerobic digestion of pot ale and pot ale/spent grain mixtures (with mixing ratios of 1:1, 1:3, and 1:5 by wet weight) was performed after implementation of a novel hybrid pre-treatment (combined chemical and mechanical) in order to modify lignocellulosic structure and ultimately enhance digestion yield.

Effects of different inoculum rates (10–30–50% on wet basis) and beating times (0–7.5–15 min) on anaerobic digestion of pot ale alone and of pot ale/spent grain mixtures were investigated in lab scale batch mode with a major focus of optimising biogas yield by using response surface methodology (RSM) in Design Expert Software. The highest biogas yields of 629  8.5 mL/g vs. (51.3% CH4) and 360  10 mL/g vs. (55.0  0.4) with anaerobic digestion of pot ale alone and spent grain mix after 1M NaOH and 7.5 min beating pre-treatments with 50% inoculum ratio respectively.

Thus, Tunisian authorities desire to encourage the development of renewable energy sources, especially from biological processes, like anaerobic digestion. Therefore, this study is focused on the evaluation of biogas and bio-methane yield from the co-digestion of three available and abundant bio-wastes in the southern regions of Tunisia. The three different raw materials are an organic fraction of municipal solid waste, chicken manure, and olive mill wastewater. In this context, experimental work to evaluate the potential of biogas and bio-methane production was carried out at mesophilic temperature 35 C and batch mode. The present work highlights the possibility of generating biogas from these organic wastes and reducing the amounts of the wastes to dispose of in landfills. The experimental study of the co-digestion process under specific conditions of carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N), T, pH, and inoculums to substrate ratio ISR provided a high yield of net methane and net biogas, in comparison with other research works. Results showed a higher specific net methane production per kg of volatile solids, which is equal to 0.338 Nm3 methane/kg VS and 0.430 Nm3 methane/kg VS for two studied cases. The obtained volatile solids reduction was found to be 91% of the initial content, for a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 40 days."
124,"title:Performance and Microbial Community Dynamics in Anaerobic Digestion of Waste Activated Sludge: Impact of Immigration,abstract:Waste activated sludge (WAS) is a byproduct of municipal wastewater treatment. WAS contains a large proportion of inactive microbes, so when it is used as a substrate for anaerobic digestion (AD), their presence can interfere with monitoring of active microbial populations. To investigate how influent cells affect the active and inactive microbial communities during digestion of WAS, we operated model mesophilic bioreactors with conventional conditions. Under six different hydraulic retention times (HRTs; 25, 23, 20, 17, 14, and 11.5 d), the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and CH4 production of the AD were within a typical range for mesophilic sludge digesters. In the main bacteria were proteobacteria, bacteroidetes, and firmicutes in both the WAS and the bioreactors, while in main archaeal methanogen group was Methanosarcinales in the WAS and methanomicrobiales in the bioreactors. Of the 106 genera identified, the estimated net growth rates were negative in 72 and positive in 34. The genera with negative growth included many aerobic taxa. The genera with positive growth rates included methanogens and syntrophs. In some taxa, the net growth rate could be positive or negative, depending on HRT, so their abundance was also affected by HRT. This study gives insights into the microbial dynamics of a conventional sludge anaerobic digester by distinguishing potentially active (growing) and inactive (non-growing, dormant) microbes and by correlating population dynamics with process parameters."
125,"title:A Review on Anaerobic Digestion of Lignocellulosic Wastes: Pretreatments and Operational Conditions,abstract:Anaerobic digestion (AD) has become extremely popular in the last years to treat and valorize organic wastes both at laboratory and industrial scales, for a wide range of highly produced organic wastes: municipal wastes, wastewater sludge, manure, agrowastes, food industry residuals, etc. Although the principles of AD are well known, it is very important to highlight that knowing the biochemical composition of waste is crucial in order to know its anaerobic biodegradability, which makes an AD process economically feasible. In this paper, we review the main principles of AD, moving to the specific features of lignocellulosic wastes, especially regarding the pretreatments that can enhance the biogas production of such wastes. The main point to consider is that lignocellulosic wastes are present in any organic wastes, and sometimes are the major fraction. Therefore, improving their AD could cause a boost in the development in this technology. The conclusions are that there is no unique strategy to improve the anaerobic biodegradability of lignocellulosic wastes, but pretreatments and codigestion both have an important role on this issue."

Anaerobic digestion is ideal for treating POME in methane production due to its tolerance to high-strength chemical oxygen demand (COD). In this work, we compared the culture conditions during the start-up of anaerobic digestion of acidified POME between thermophilic (55 C) and mesophilic (37 C) temperatures. The pH of the digester was maintained throughout the experiment at 7.30  0.2 in a working volume of 1000 mL. This study revealed that the thermophilic temperature stabilized faster on the 44th day compared to the 52nd day for the mesophilic temperature. Furthermore, the thermophilic temperature indicated higher biogas production at 0.60 L-CH4 /Ld compared to the mesophilic temperature at 0.26 L-CH4 /Ld. Results from this study were consistent with the COD removal of thermophilic temperature which was also higher than the mesophilic temperature."

130,"title:Treatment of Cattle Manure by Anaerobic Co-Digestion with Food Waste and Pig Manure: Methane Yield and Synergistic Effect,abstract:The management of cattle manure (CM) has become increasingly challenging because its production continues to rise, while the regulations on manure management have become increasingly stringent. In Korea, most farms produce CM as a dry mixture with lignocellulosic bedding materials (mainly sawdust), making it impractical to treat CM by anaerobic digestion. To address this problem, this study examined whether anaerobic co-digestion with food waste (FW) and pig manure (PM) could be an effective approach for the treatment of CM. The batch anaerobic digestion tests at different CM: FW: PM mixing ratios showed that more methane was produced as the FW fraction increased, and as the CM fraction decreased. The response surface models describing how the substrate mixing ratio affects the methane yield and synergistic effect (methane yield basis) were successfully generated. The models proved that the methane yield and synergistic effect respond differently to changes in the substrate mixing ratio. The maximum 30-day methane yield was predicted at 100% FW, whereas the maximum 30-day synergy index was estimated for the mixture of 47% CM, 6% FW, and 47% PM (total solids basis). The synergy index model showed that CM, FW, and PM could be co-digested without a substantial loss of their methane potential at any mixing ratio (30-day synergy index, 0.89–1.22), and that a possible antagonistic effect could be avoided by keeping the FW proportion less than 50%. The results suggest that co-digestion with PM and FW could be flexibly applied for the treatment and valorization of CM in existing anaerobic digestion plants treating FW and PM."

135,"title:Biogas from Anaerobic Digestion: Power Generation or Biomethane Production?,abstract:Biogas is a fuel obtained from organic waste fermentation and can be an interesting solution for producing electric energy, heat and fuel. Recently, many European countries have incentivized the production of biomethane to be injected into natural gas grids or compressed and used as biofuel in vehicles. The introduction of an upgrading unit into an existing anaerobic digestion plant to convert biogas to biomethane may have a strong impact on the overall energy balance of the systems. The amount of biomethane produced may be optimized from several points of view (i.e., energy, environmental and economic). In this paper, the mass and energy fluxes of an anaerobic digestion plant were analyzed as a function of the biogas percentage sent to the upgrading system and the amount of biomethane produced. A numerical model of an anaerobic digestion plant was developed by considering an existing case study. The mass and energy balance of the digesters, cogeneration unit, upgrading system and auxiliary boiler were estimated when the amount of produced biomethane was varied. An internal combustion engine was adopted as the cogeneration unit and a CO2 absorption system was assumed for biogas upgrading. Results demonstrated that the energy balance of the plant is strictly dependent on the biomethane production and that an excess of biomethane production makes the plant totally dependent on external energy sources. As for the environmental impact, an optimal level of biomethane production exists that minimizes the emissions of equivalent CO2. However, high biomethane subsides can encourage plant managers to increase biomethane production and thus reduce CO2 savings."

Through global chemical profiling, the chemical characteristics of different digestates and types of manure were displayed during the anaerobic digestion (AD) process. As the feed for AD, CM had less easily-degradable organics, SM contained the least O-alkyls and anomerics of carbohydrates, and CHM exhibited relatively lower bio-stability. The derived metabolite pathways of different manure during the AD process were identified by MetaboAnalyst. Twelve, 8, and 5 metabolic pathways were affected by the AD process in CHM, SM, and CM, respectively. Furthermore, bioactive compounds of digestate were detected, such as amino acids (L-arginine, L-ornithine, L-cysteine, and L-aspartate), hormones (L-adrenaline, 19-hydroxy androstenedione, and estrone), alkaloids (tryptamine and N-methyltyramine), and vitamin B5, in different types of manure and their digestates.

Seedlings of tomato and marigold were amended at various volume per volume (v/v) ratios with plant foods consisting of fine solids upcycled (i.e., transformed into a higher quality product) by drying and blending with other organic residuals. A plate competition assay was conducted to assess the fine solids’ potential to suppress the plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani. Plant foods were comprised of 2.0–2.1% N, 0.8–0.9% P and 0.6–0.8% K. Extractions indicated that plant foods contained a mixture of plant-available and slow-release P. At 6% v/v plant food, dry biomass of marigold and tomato were six-times greater than the unamended control and not significantly different from a market alternative treatment. Fine solids exhibited negligible potential to suppress R. solani. This study indicates that DAF-separated fine solids could be used to support horticulture, providing information for design of a circular economy approach to dairy manure nutrient management. Life cycle assessment and business model development for this nutrient recovery strategy are necessary next steps to further guide sustainability efforts."
145,"title:A Brief Review of Anaerobic Digestion of Algae for Bioenergy,abstract:The potential of algal biomass as a source of liquid and gaseous biofuels has been the subject of considerable research over the past few decades, with researchers strongly agreeing that algae have the potential of becoming a viable aquatic energy crop with a higher energy potential compared to that from either terrestrial biomass or municipal solid waste. However, neither microalgae nor seaweed are currently cultivated solely for energy purposes due to the high costs of harvesting, concentrating and drying. Anaerobic digestion of algal biomass could theoretically reduce costs associated with drying wet biomass before processing, but practical yields of biogas from digestion of many algae are substantially below the theoretical maximum. New processing methods are needed to reduce costs and increase the net energy balance. This review examines the biochemical and structural properties of seaweeds and of microalgal biomass that has been produced as part of the treatment of wastewater, and discusses some of the significant hurdles and recent initiatives for producing biogas from their anaerobic digestion."

The efficiency of these pretreatments on both ammonia removal—recovering ammonia salts to be used as fertilizers in agriculture—and the increase of methane production were assessed in batch tests. Since the pH, temperature, and air flow rate heavily influence AS efficiency and the composition of treated SW, these parameters were set individually or in combination. In more detail, the pH was increased from the natural value of SW to 8 or 10, temperature was increased from the room value to 40 C, and the air flow rate was increased from zero to 5 Lair LSW-1 min-1. AS was generally more efficient at removing ammonia (up to 97%) from raw (non-treated) SW compared to the other treatments. However, the tested pretreatments were not as efficient as expected in increasing the biogas production, because the methane yields of all pretreated substrates were lower (by about 10–50%) to compared raw SW. The inhibitory effect on AD could have been due to the lack of nutrients and organic matter in the substrate (due to the excessive removal of the pretreatments), the concentration of toxic compounds (such as metal ions or furfural due to water evaporation), and an excess of alkali ions (used to increase the pH in AS). Overall, AS can be considered a sustainable process for the recovery of ammonium sulphate and the removal of other polluting compounds (e.g., organic matter) from SW. Conversely, the use of AS and other chemical and/or thermal processes tested in this study as pretreatments of SW before AD is not advised because these processes appear to reduce methane yields."

Microbial communities were also evaluated to get an insight of the changes caused by the operational modifications of the digester. An energy evaluation of this alternative was performed considering the theoretical process of coupling bioelectrochemical systems (BES) for the treatment of wastewater along with hydrogen production and the subsequent anaerobic digestion. The addition of hydrogen to sewage sludge digestion resulted in an increase of 12% in biogas production over the control (1353 mL CH4 d-1 at an injection flow rate of 1938 mL H2 d-1). The liquid phase of the sludge reactor and the H2 supplemented one did not show significant differences, thus indicating that the application of hydrogen as the co-substrate was not detrimental. High-throughput sequencing analysis showed slight changes in archaeal relative abundance after hydrogen addition, whereas eubacterial community structure and composition revealed noteworthy shifts. The mass and energy balance indicated that the amount of hydrogen obtained from a hypothetical BES can be assimilated in the sludge digester, improving biogas production, but this configuration was not capable of covering all energy needs under the proposed scenario."

154,"title:Integration of Hydrothermal Carbonisation with Anaerobic Digestion; Opportunities for Valorisation of Digestate,abstract:Hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) has been identified as a potential route for digestate enhancement producing a solid hydrochar and a process water rich in organic carbon. This study compares the treatment of four dissimilar digestates from anaerobic digestion (AD) of agricultural residue (AGR); sewage sludge (SS); residual municipal solid waste (MSW), and vegetable, garden, and fruit waste (VGF). HTC experiments were performed at 150, 200 and 250 C for 1 h using 10%, 20%, and 30% solid loadings of a fixed water mass. The effect of temperature and solid loading to the properties of biocoal and biochemical methane potential (BMP) of process waters are investigated. Results show that the behaviour of digestate during HTC is feedstock dependent and the hydrochar produced is a poor-quality solid fuel. The AGR digestate produced the greatest higher heating value (HHV) of 24 MJ/kg, however its biocoal properties are poor due to slagging and fouling propensities. The SS digestate process water produced the highest amount of biogas at 200 C and 30% solid loading. This study concludes that solely treating digestate via HTC enhances biogas production and that hydrochar be investigated for its use as a soil amender."

The optimal conditions for four major factors that affect the recovery of N and P were derived by conducting batch experiments on AD effluents obtained from four AD facilities. The optimal conditions were a pH of 10.0, NH4-N:Mg:PO4-P molar ratio of 1:1.4:1, mixing intensity of 240 s-1, and mixing duration of 2 min. Under these optimal conditions, the removal efficiencies of NH4-N and PO4-P were approximately 74% and 83%, respectively, whereas those of Cu and Zn were approximately 74% and 79%, respectively. Herein, a model for swine manure treatment that incorporates AD, struvite precipitation, and biological treatment processes is proposed. We applied this model to 85 public biological treatment facilities in South Korea and recovered 4722 and 51 tons/yr of NH4-N and PO4-P, respectively. The economic analysis of the proposed model’s performance predicts a lack of profitability due to the high cost of chemicals; however, this analysis does not consider the resulting protection of the hydrological environment. Field-scale studies should be conducted in future to prove the effectiveness of the model."
156,"title:Semi-Continuous Anaerobic Digestion of Orange Peel Waste: Effect of Activated Carbon Addition and Alkaline Pretreatment on the Process,abstract:The valorization of orange peel waste (OPW) is sought worldwide mainly via anaerobic digestion. A common problem encountered during the biological treatment is the seasonality of its production and the presence of d-Limonene. The latter is a typical anti-microbial compound. This work aims to evaluate the effect of the use of granular activated carbon (GAC) combined with alkaline pretreatment to enhance methane generation during semi-continuous anaerobic digestion of OPW. The experimental design consisted of two groups of experiments, A and B. Experiment A was designed to verify the maximum OPW loading and to assess the effect of pH and nutrients on the process. Experiment B was designed to study the effect of alkaline pretreatment alone and of alkaline pretreatment aided by biochar addition to the process. Apart from the methane yields, the d-Limonene contents were measured in all experiments. The preliminary results showed that OPW alkaline pretreatment after the addition of a moderate amount of GAC can render anaerobic digestion of OPW sustainable as long as the organic loading does not exceed 2 gVSL-1day-1 and nutrients are supplemented. The experiment in which GAC was added after alkaline pretreatment resulted in the highest methane yield and reactor stability."

The results indicated that the use of iron as anode and cathode is the most suitable solution among different electrode combinations. The reduction of turbidity, total chemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus, total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Enterococci, and phages in the reclaimed water were 99%, 91%, 100%, 1.5 log, 1.7 log, 1.0 log, and 2.0 log, respectively. The economic assessment further concluded that the average treatment cost is $3 per 1000 L for a small-scale operation handling 3000 L wastewater/day. This study demonstrated that the electrocoagulation (EC) is a promising technique for the recovery and reclamation of water from anaerobic digestion effluent. Even though its energy consumption is higher and the nitrogen removal is insufficient compared to some conventional wastewater treatment technologies, there are several advantages of the EC treatment, such as short retention time, small footprint, no mixing, and gradual addition of coagulants. These features make EC technology applicable to be used alone or combined with other technologies for a wide range of wastewater treatment applications."
158,"title:Adjusting Organic Load as a Strategy to Direct Single-Stage Food Waste Fermentation from Anaerobic Digestion to Chain Elongation,abstract:Production of medium chain carboxylic acids (MCCA) as renewable feedstock bio-chemicals, from food waste (FW), requires complicated reactor configurations and supplementation of chemicals to achieve product selectivity. This study evaluated the manipulation of organic loading rate in an un-supplemented, single stage stirred tank reactor to steer an anaerobic digestion (AD) microbiome towards acidogenic fermentation (AF), and thence to chain elongation. Increasing substrate availability by switching to a FW feedstock with a higher COD stimulated chain elongation. The MCCA species n-caproic (10.1  1.7 g L-1) and n-caprylic (2.9  0.8 g L-1) acid were produced at concentrations comparable to more complex reactor set-ups. As a result, of the adjusted operating strategy, a more specialised microbiome developed containing several MCCA-producing bacteria, lactic acid-producing Olsenella spp. and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. By contrast, in an AD reactor that was operated in parallel to produce biogas, the retention times had to be doubled when fed with the high-COD FW to maintain biogas production. The AD microbiome comprised a diverse mixture of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria, and acetoclastic methanogens. The results suggest that manipulation of organic loading rate and food-to-microorganism ratio may be used as an operating strategy to direct an AD microbiome towards AF, and to stimulate chain elongation in FW fermentation, using a simple, un-supplemented stirred tank set-up. This outcome provides the opportunity to repurpose existing AD assets operating on food waste for biogas production, to produce potentially higher value MCCA products, via simple manipulation of the feeding strategy."
159,"title:Impact of Storage Conditions on the Methanogenic Activity of Anaerobic Digestion Inocula,abstract:The impact of storage temperature (4, 22 and 37 C) and storage time (7, 14 and 21 days) on anaerobic digestion inocula was investigated through specific methanogenic activity assays. Experimental results showed that methanogenic activity decreased over time with storage, regardless of storage temperature. However, the rate at which the methanogenic activity decreased was two and five times slower at 4 C than at 22 and 37 C, respectively. The inoculum stored at 4 C and room temperature (22 C) maintained methanogenic activity close to that of fresh inoculum for 14 days (<10% difference). However, a storage temperature of 4 C is preferred because of the slower decrease in activity with lengthier storage time. From this research, it was concluded that inoculum storage time should generally be kept to a minimum, but that storage at 4 C could help maintain methanogenic activity for longer."

The results indicated that the cumulative biogas yield and methane content were enhanced to 563.82 mL/gVS and 63.7% by adding EDTA-Ni, respectively, which were almost 1.15 and 1.07-fold of that in the R2 with Ni2+ addition alone. At the same time, an obvious decrease of propionic acid was observed after EDTA-Ni addition. The speciation analysis of Ni showed that the percentages of water-soluble and exchangeable Ni were increased to 38.8% and 36.3% due to EDTA-Ni addition, respectively. Also, the high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the EDTA-Ni promoted the growth and metabolism of Methanosarcina and Methanobacterium, which might be the major reason for propionic acid degradation and methane production."
164,"title:On the Effect of Aqueous Ammonia Soaking Pre-Treatment on Continuous Anaerobic Digestion of Digested Swine Manure Fibers,abstract:(1) Background: The continuously increasing demand for renewable energy sources renders anaerobic digestion as one of the most promising technologies for renewable energy production. Due to the animal production intensification, manure is being used as the primary feedstock for most biogas plants. Their economical profitable operation, however, relies on increasing the methane yield from the solid fraction of manure, which is not so easily degradable. The solid fraction after anaerobic digestion, the so-called digested fibers, consists mainly of hardly biodegradable material and comes at a lower mass per unit volume of manure compared to the solid fraction before anaerobic digestion. Therefore, investigation on how to increase the biodegradability of digested fibers is very relevant. So far, Aqueous Ammonia Soaking (AAS), has been successfully applied on digested fibers separated from the effluent of a manure-fed, full-scale anaerobic digester to enhance their methane productivity in batch experiments. (2) Methods: In the present study, continuous experiments at a mesophilic (38 C) CSTR-type anaerobic digester fed with swine manure first and a mixture of manure with AAS-treated digested fibers in the sequel, were performed. Anaerobic Digestion Model 1 (ADM1) previously fitted on manure fed digester was used in order to assess the effect of the addition of AAS-pre-treated digested manure fibers on the kinetics of anaerobic digestion process. (3) Results and Conclusions: The methane yield of AAS-treated digested fibers under continuous operation was 49–68% higher than that calculated in batch experiments in the past. It was found that AAS treatment had a profound effect mainly on the disintegration/hydrolysis rate of particulate carbohydrates. Comparison of the data obtained in the present study with the data obtained with AAS-pre-treated raw manure fibers in the past revealed that hydrolysis kinetics after AAS pre-treatment were similar for both types of biomasses."
165,"title:Physical Properties of Dairy Manure Pre- and Post-Anaerobic Digestion,abstract:Manure characteristics change through processing, including anaerobic digestion (AD). These changes can alter handling of manure during downstream operations. This study analyzed the density, total solids (TS) content, and volatile solids (VS) content of pre-digested and anaerobically digested dairy manure from seven dairy farms in Wisconsin. The density of pre-digested manure increased from 990 to 1065 kg m-3 as the TS level increased from 1.5% to 13.0%. Density and TS for pre-digested manure from facilities using separated solids as bedding were related with a linear model for TS ranging from 1.5% to 13.0% and with a polynomial model for TS ranging from 1.5% to 50%. The model shows that density decreases with an increasing TS content when TS is greater than 8.0%. Manure from dairy facilities that used sand bedding had a VS/TS ratio of 0.87. This ratio was higher than the ratio when manure solids were used as bedding (0.81) and when food waste was incorporated into the digester (0.77). This study also provides a simple methodology to estimate biogas yield by using the density of pre- and post-digested manure."

168,"title:Impact of Storage Conditions on the Methanogenic Activity of Anaerobic Digestion Inocula,abstract:The impact of storage temperature (4, 22 and 37 C) and storage time (7, 14 and 21 days) on anaerobic digestion inocula was investigated through specific methanogenic activity assays. Experimental results showed that methanogenic activity decreased over time with storage, regardless of storage temperature. However, the rate at which the methanogenic activity decreased was two and five times slower at 4 C than at 22 and 37 C, respectively. The inoculum stored at 4 C and room temperature (22 C) maintained methanogenic activity close to that of fresh inoculum for 14 days (<10% difference). However, a storage temperature of 4 C is preferred because of the slower decrease in activity with lengthier storage time. From this research, it was concluded that inoculum storage time should generally be kept to a minimum, but that storage at 4 C could help maintain methanogenic activity for longer."
169,"title:Coupling Hydrothermal Carbonization with Anaerobic Digestion for Sewage Sludge Treatment: Influence of HTC Liquor and Hydrochar on Biomethane Production,abstract:The present study addresses the coupling of hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) with anaerobic digestion (AD) in wastewater treatment plants. The improvement in biomethane production due to the recycling back to the anaerobic digester of HTC liquor and hydrochar generated from digested sludge is investigated and proved. Mixtures of different compositions of HTC liquor and hydrochar, as well as individual substrates, were tested. The biomethane yield reached 102  3 mL CH4 g-1 COD when the HTC liquor was cycled back to the AD and treated together with primary and secondary sludge. Thus, the biomethane production was almost doubled compared to that of the AD of primary and secondary sludge (55  20 mL CH4 g-1 COD). The benefit is even more significant when both the HTC liquor and the hydrochar were fed to the AD of primary and secondary sludge. The biomethane yield increased up to 187  18 mL CH4 g-1 COD when 45% of hydrochar, with respect to the total feedstock, was added. These results highlight the improvement that the HTC process can bring to AD, enhancing biomethane production and promoting a sustainable solution for the treatment of the HTC liquor and possibly the hydrochar itself."
170,"title:Upcycling Phosphorus Recovered from Anaerobically Digested Dairy Manure to Support Production of Vegetables and Flowers,abstract:Dissolved air flotation (DAF) separates phosphorus (P)-rich fine solids from anaerobically digested dairy manure, creating opportunities to export surplus P to the marketplace as a bagged plant food product. Seedlings of tomato and marigold were amended at various volume per volume (v/v) ratios with plant foods consisting of fine solids upcycled (i.e., transformed into a higher quality product) by drying and blending with other organic residuals. A plate competition assay was conducted to assess the fine solids’ potential to suppress the plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani. Plant foods were comprised of 2.0–2.1% N, 0.8–0.9% P and 0.6–0.8% K. Extractions indicated that plant foods contained a mixture of plant-available and slow-release P. At 6% v/v plant food, dry biomass of marigold and tomato were six-times greater than the unamended control and not significantly different from a market alternative treatment. Fine solids exhibited negligible potential to suppress R. solani. This study indicates that DAF-separated fine solids could be used to support horticulture, providing information for design of a circular economy approach to dairy manure nutrient management. Life cycle assessment and business model development for this nutrient recovery strategy are necessary next steps to further guide sustainability efforts."
171,"title:Cyanobacterial Growth in Minimally Amended Anaerobic Digestion Effluent and Flue-Gas,abstract:Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an important industrial process, particularly in a biorefinery approach. The liquid effluent and carbon dioxide in the off-gas, can be used to produce high-value products through the cultivation of cyanobacteria. Growth on AD effluent is often limited due to substrate limitation or inhibitory compounds. This study demonstrates the successful cultivation of Synechococcus on minimally amended AD effluent, supplemented with MgSO4 and diluted with seawater. An 8 L airlift reactor illustrated growth in a pilot scale setup. Higher biomass yields were observed for cyanobacteria grown in diluted AD effluent compared to minimal medium, with 60% total nitrogen removal in the effluent. It was demonstrated that controlling the pH, increasing dissolved salt concentrations and adding MgSO4 to the effluent allowed for the successful cultivation of the cyanobacterium, circumventing the addition of clean water for effluent dilution. This could ultimately increase the feasibility of anaerobic digestion-microalgae integrated biorefineries."

174,"title:Dry Anaerobic Digestion of Chicken Manure: A Review,abstract:Providing anaerobic digestion is a prospective technology for utilizing organic waste, however, for waste with a high content of nitrogen such as manure, dilution is necessary to decrease the ammonia inhibition effect which leads to the production of a huge effluent amount which is difficult to use. Dry anaerobic digestion has some advantages such as reduced reactor volume, higher volumetric methane yield, lower energy consumption for heating, less wastewater production, and lower logistic costs for fertilizers. These factors generate interest in using it for treatment of even high-nitrogen substrates. The purpose of this work was to analyze different dry anaerobic digestion technologies, the features of dry anaerobic digestion, laboratory studies on chicken manure dry anaerobic digestion, and methods of reducing inhibitors’ effects. Nowadays, there are no dry anaerobic industrial plants working on chicken manure. However, studies on dry anaerobic digestion of chicken manure have proven the possibility of methane production under fermentation of chicken manure with high total solids content, but the process has been described as being unstable. Co-fermentation, ammonium/ammonia removal, and adaptation of the microbial consortium have been used to decrease the effect of ammonia inhibition. A prospective way for ammonia concentration control is absorption using a non-volatile sorbent located in the reactor. It decreases ammonia content during wet anaerobic digestion by 33% and it is characterized by having a positive economic effect. Therefore, dry anaerobic fermentation of chicken manure is possible, but there is still no efficient way to provide it. The results of this article should be helpful in the selection of anaerobic digestion technology for treating chicken manure."
175,"title:Improvement of Waste Dehydrated Sludge for Anaerobic Digestion through High-Temperature and High-Pressure Solubilization,abstract:Biochemical methane potential tests and lab-scale continuous experiments were conducted to improve the yield and energy efficiency of anaerobic digestion through thermal hydrolysis pre-treatment. Methane generation, yield, and solubilization efficiency were evaluated through lab-scale tests. The pre-treated samples presented 50% biodegradability at 140 C and 61.5% biodegradability at 165 C. The increase in biodegradability was insignificant at 165 C or higher temperature, and it was confirmed that the optimum conditions were achieved at 165 C and 20 min of solubilization. The lab-scale continuous experiments confirmed that polymers were decomposed into low-molecular-weight compounds due to thermal hydrolysis, and pH decreased. NH4HCO3 produced by thermal hydrolysis acted as an alkali to enable a more stable operation compared to that before thermal hydrolysis. Total chemical oxygen demand as chromium (TCODCr) and soluble chemical oxygen demand as chromium (SCODCr) indicated 35.4% and 23.1% removal efficiency in terms of organic matter removal, respectively. Methane yield was approximately 0.35 kg m-3 at 2.0–4.0 kg (m3 d)-1 and 0.26 kg m-3 at 5.0 kg (m3 d)-1. The solubilization rate of 40.9% by thermal hydrolysis was confirmed through the lab-scale tests to determine its full-scale applicability."
176,"title:Biogas from Anaerobic Digestion: Power Generation or Biomethane Production?,abstract:Biogas is a fuel obtained from organic waste fermentation and can be an interesting solution for producing electric energy, heat and fuel. Recently, many European countries have incentivized the production of biomethane to be injected into natural gas grids or compressed and used as biofuel in vehicles. The introduction of an upgrading unit into an existing anaerobic digestion plant to convert biogas to biomethane may have a strong impact on the overall energy balance of the systems. The amount of biomethane produced may be optimized from several points of view (i.e., energy, environmental and economic). In this paper, the mass and energy fluxes of an anaerobic digestion plant were analyzed as a function of the biogas percentage sent to the upgrading system and the amount of biomethane produced. A numerical model of an anaerobic digestion plant was developed by considering an existing case study. The mass and energy balance of the digesters, cogeneration unit, upgrading system and auxiliary boiler were estimated when the amount of produced biomethane was varied. An internal combustion engine was adopted as the cogeneration unit and a CO2 absorption system was assumed for biogas upgrading. Results demonstrated that the energy balance of the plant is strictly dependent on the biomethane production and that an excess of biomethane production makes the plant totally dependent on external energy sources. As for the environmental impact, an optimal level of biomethane production exists that minimizes the emissions of equivalent CO2. However, high biomethane subsides can encourage plant managers to increase biomethane production and thus reduce CO2 savings."
177,"title:Treatment of Cattle Manure by Anaerobic Co-Digestion with Food Waste and Pig Manure: Methane Yield and Synergistic Effect,abstract:The management of cattle manure (CM) has become increasingly challenging because its production continues to rise, while the regulations on manure management have become increasingly stringent. In Korea, most farms produce CM as a dry mixture with lignocellulosic bedding materials (mainly sawdust), making it impractical to treat CM by anaerobic digestion. To address this problem, this study examined whether anaerobic co-digestion with food waste (FW) and pig manure (PM) could be an effective approach for the treatment of CM. The batch anaerobic digestion tests at different CM: FW: PM mixing ratios showed that more methane was produced as the FW fraction increased, and as the CM fraction decreased. The response surface models describing how the substrate mixing ratio affects the methane yield and synergistic effect (methane yield basis) were successfully generated. The models proved that the methane yield and synergistic effect respond differently to changes in the substrate mixing ratio. The maximum 30-day methane yield was predicted at 100% FW, whereas the maximum 30-day synergy index was estimated for the mixture of 47% CM, 6% FW, and 47% PM (total solids basis). The synergy index model showed that CM, FW, and PM could be co-digested without a substantial loss of their methane potential at any mixing ratio (30-day synergy index, 0.89–1.22), and that a possible antagonistic effect could be avoided by keeping the FW proportion less than 50%. The results suggest that co-digestion with PM and FW could be flexibly applied for the treatment and valorization of CM in existing anaerobic digestion plants treating FW and PM."

179,"title:Integrated Membrane Process for the Treatment and Reuse of Residual Table Olive Fermentation Brine and Anaerobically Digested Sludge Centrate,abstract:Management of wastewater is a major challenge nowadays, due to increasing water demand, growing population and more stringent regulations on water quality. Wastewaters from food conservation are especially difficult to treat, since they have high salinity and high organic matter concentration. The aim of this work is the treatment of the effluent from a table olive fermentation process (FTOP) with the aim of reusing it once the organic matter is separated. The process proposed in this work consists of the following membrane-based technologies: Ultrafiltration (UF) (UP005, Microdyn Nadir), Forward Osmosis (FO) (Osmen2521, Hydration Technology Innovation) and Nanofiltration (NF) (NF245, Dow). The FO process was implemented to reduce the salinity entering the NF process, using the FTOP as draw solution and, at the same time, to concentrate the centrate produced in the sludge treatment of a municipal wastewater treatment plant with the aim of obtaining a stream enriched in nutrients. The UF step achieved the elimination of 50% of the chemical oxygen demand of the FTOP. The UF permeate was pumped to the FO system reducing the volume of the anaerobically digested sludge centrate (ADSC) by a factor of 3 in 6.5 h. Finally, the ultrafiltrated FTOP diluted by FO was subjected to NF. The transmembrane pressure needed in the NF stage was 40% lower than that required if the ultrafiltration permeate was directly nanofiltered. By means of the integrated process, the concentration of organic matter and phenolic compounds in the FTOP decreased by 97%. Therefore, the proposed process was able to obtain a treated brine that could be reused in other processes and simultaneously to concentrate a stream, such as the ADSC."
180,"title:Role of Microbial Hydrolysis in Anaerobic Digestion,abstract:There is a growing need of substrate flexibility for biobased production of energy and value-added products that allows the application of variable biodegradable residues within a circular economy. It can be used to balance fluctuating energy provision of other renewable sources. Hydrolysis presents one of the biggest limitations during anaerobic digestion. Methods to improve it will result in broader process applicability and improved integration into regional material cycles. Recently, one focus of anaerobic digestion research has been directed to systems with a separate hydrolysis–acidogenesis stage as it might be promised to improve process performance. Conditions can be adjusted to each class of microorganisms individually without harming methanogenic microorganisms. Extensive research of separate biomass pretreatment via biological, chemical, physical or mixed methods has been conducted. Nevertheless, several methods lack economic efficiency, have a high environmental impact or focus on specific substrates. Pretreatment via a separate hydrolysis stage as cell-driven biotransformation in a suspension might be an alternative that enables high yields, flexible feeding and production, and a better process control. In this review, we summarize existing technologies for microbial hydrolytic biotransformation in a separate reactor stage and the impacts of substrate, operational parameters, combined methods and process design as well as remaining challenges."

182,"title:Influences of Temperature and Substrate Particle Content on Granular Sludge Bed Anaerobic Digestion,abstract:Influences of temperature (25–35 C) and substrate particulate content (3.0–9.4 g total suspended solids (TSS)/L) on granular sludge bed anaerobic digestion (AD) were analyzed in lab-scale reactors using manure as a substrate and through modeling. Two particle levels were tested using raw (RF) and centrifuged (CF) swine manure slurries, fed into a 1.3-L lab-scale up-flow anaerobic sludge bed reactor (UASB) at temperatures of 25 C and 35 C. Biogas production increased with temperature in both high- and low-particle-content substrates; however, the temperature effect was stronger on high-particle-content substrate. RF and CF produced a comparable amount of biogas at 25 C, suggesting that biogas at this temperature came mainly from the digestion of small particles and soluble components present in similar quantities in both substrates. At 35 C, RF showed significantly higher biogas production than CF, which was attributed to increased (temperature-dependent) disintegration of larger solid particulates. Anaerobic Digestion Model No.1 (ADM1) based modeling was carried out by separating particulates into fast and slow disintegrating fractions and introducing temperature-dependent disintegration constants. Simulations gave a better fit for the experimental data than the conventional ADM1 model."

In order to better understand the mechanisms of biological hydrolysis (BH) pretreatment on AD, biochemical methane potential (BMP) and continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) tests were utilized to compare untreated municipal combined sludge with pilot-scale BH pretreated sludge. During the BH process, there was 15%, 30%, and 33% (w/w) volatile solids (VS) reduction after BH at 42 C (BH42) for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively; under BH61 (42 C for 36 h and 61 C for 6 h), and there was 10% and 30% (w/w) overall VS reduction after 36-h and 42-h hydrolysis, respectively. BMP results showed that BH42-pretreated sludge had 22.6% enhancement of methane yield compared to untreated sludge, and BH61 pretreated sludge had 29.4% enhancement of methane yield. Both temperature and solids’ retention time (SRT) contributed to the enhanced AD performance within 36 h, while temperature played more important roles after 36-h BH pretreatment. CSTR tests confirmed the acceleration of anaerobic digestion by BH pretreatment, and higher enhancement was observed when SRT of anaerobic digestion was shorter than 16 days. Through a literature review of BH-related studies, the possible mechanisms were highlighted for further optimization on the scale-up systems in order to reduce carbon footprint and operating expenditure for wastewater treatment plants."

190,"title:The Effects of Halogenated Compounds on the Anaerobic Digestion of Macroalgae,abstract:The urgent need to replace fossil fuels has seen macroalgae advancing as a potential feedstock for anaerobic digestion. The natural methane productivity (dry weight per hectare) of seaweeds is greater than in many terrestrial plant systems. As part of their defence systems, seaweeds, unlike terrestrial plants, produce a range of halogenated secondary metabolites, especially chlorinated and brominated compounds. Some orders of brown seaweeds also accumulate iodine, up to 1.2% of their dry weight. Fluorine remains rather unusual within the chemical structure. Halogenated hydrocarbons have moderate to high toxicities. In addition, halogenated organic compounds constitute a large group of environmental chemicals due to their extensive use in industry and agriculture. In recent years, concerns over the environmental fate and release of these halogenated organic compounds have resulted in research into their biodegradation and the evidence emerging shows that many of these compounds are more easily degraded under strictly anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic biodegradation. Biosorption via seaweed has become an alternative to the existing technologies in removing these pollutants. Halogenated compounds are known inhibitors of methane production from ruminants and humanmade anaerobic digesters. The focus of this paper is reviewing the available information on the effects of halogenated organic compounds on anaerobic digestion."

Biogas from the SSAD of dairy cattle manure, and the digestate of SSAD was fed to BSFL. In turn, BSFL can be fed to animals as a protein supplement. Adjustment of the pH and 30% inoculation ratio (IR30) during SSAD produced the highest theoretical methane yield, 626.1  28.7 L CH4/kg VSdes, with an ultimate methane yield of 96.81  2.0 L CH4/kg VSload. For BSFL composting, the groups with a feeding rate of 75 and 100 mg/day/larvae had the highest body weight change, which was 969.6  28.4% and 984.1  177.6%, respectively.

196,"title:Integration of Hydrothermal Carbonisation with Anaerobic Digestion; Opportunities for Valorisation of Digestate,abstract:Hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) has been identified as a potential route for digestate enhancement producing a solid hydrochar and a process water rich in organic carbon. This study compares the treatment of four dissimilar digestates from anaerobic digestion (AD) of agricultural residue (AGR); sewage sludge (SS); residual municipal solid waste (MSW), and vegetable, garden, and fruit waste (VGF). HTC experiments were performed at 150, 200 and 250 C for 1 h using 10%, 20%, and 30% solid loadings of a fixed water mass. The effect of temperature and solid loading to the properties of biocoal and biochemical methane potential (BMP) of process waters are investigated. Results show that the behaviour of digestate during HTC is feedstock dependent and the hydrochar produced is a poor-quality solid fuel. The AGR digestate produced the greatest higher heating value (HHV) of 24 MJ/kg, however its biocoal properties are poor due to slagging and fouling propensities. The SS digestate process water produced the highest amount of biogas at 200 C and 30% solid loading. This study concludes that solely treating digestate via HTC enhances biogas production and that hydrochar be investigated for its use as a soil amender."

The study of growth kinetics of the biochemical methane potential test revealed that a maximum of 36% increase in methane yield was observed from co-digestion of a substrate pretreated by thermophilic aerobic conditions (55 C and HRT = 2 days) and an 8.3% increase was obtained from the anaerobic pretreated substrate (55 C and HRT = 3 days). Moreover, no synergistic effects on methane yields were observed in co-digesting the substrate pretreated with high temperature (85 C). The study also identified specific conditions in which interaction between biological pretreatment and co-digestion might substantially reduce methane yield. Careful optimization of operating conditions, both aerobic and anaerobic pretreatment at moderate thermophilic conditions, can be used as a biological pretreatment to enhance methane yield from the co-digestion of microalgae and primary sludge."

This study compares different integration strategies of hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) and anaerobic digestion (AD) using WH, across a range of temperatures. These include (i) hydrochar combustion and process water digestion, (ii) hydrochar digestion, (iii) slurry digestion. HTC reactions were conducted at 150 C, 200 C, and 250 C. Separation of hydrochars for combustion and process waters for digestion offers the most energetically-feasible valorisation route.

In this work, the impact of granular activated carbon (GAC) on the mesophilic anaerobic co-digestion of sugar beet pulp and distillers grains was investigated. After a short period, anaerobic reactors began to produce biomethane and were ready for completion within 19–24 days. The addition of GAC to reactors (5–10 g L-1) significantly enhanced the methane production rate and consumption of produced volatile fatty acids. Thus, the maximum methane production rate increased by 13.7% in the presence of GAC (5 g L-1). Bacterial and archaeal community structure and dynamics were investigated, based on 16S rRNA genes analysis. The abundant classes of bacteria in GAC-free and GAC-containing reactors were Clostridia, Bacteroidia, Actinobacteria, and Synergistia. Methanogenic communities were mainly represented by the genera Methanosarcina, Methanoculleus, Methanothrix, and Methanomassiliicoccus in GAC-free and GAC-containing reactors. Our results indicate that the addition of granular activated carbon at appropriate dosages has a positive effect on anaerobic co-digestion of by-products of the processing of sugar beet and ethanol distillation process."

Moreover, the recovery of the phenols, which are well-known microbial inhibitors, could improve the subsequent biomethanization of the dephenolized OMSW to produce energy. However, there is a considerable lack of knowledge about how the remaining phenolic compounds could affect a long-term biomethanization process of steam-exploded OMSW. This work evaluated a semi-continuous mesophilic anaerobic digestion of dephenolized steam-exploited OMSW during a long operational period (275 days), assessing different organic loading rates (OLRs). The process was stable at an OLR of 1 gVS/(Ld), with a specific production rate of 163  28 mL CH4/(gVSd). However, the increment of the OLR up to 2 gVS/(Ld) resulted in total exhaust of the methane production. The increment in the propionic acid concentration up to 1486 mg/L could be the main responsible factor for the inhibition. Regardless of the OLR, the concentration of phenolic compounds was always lower than the inhibition limits. Therefore, steam-exploited OMSW could be a suitable substrate for anaerobic digestion at a suitable OLR."

208,"title:Interactive Effects of Chemical Composition of Food Waste during Anaerobic Co-Digestion under Thermophilic Temperature,abstract:The effects of chemical composition (carbohydrates, lipids, and protein) on the anaerobic co-digestion performance of food wastes (FW) were investigated from the viewpoints of methane production, dynamic parameters, and microbial community structure. The results of this study showed that a notable gasification rate was positively correlated with the proportion of the composition. A T2 reactor, which consisted of 60% carbohydrates, 20% lipids, and 20% protein, held a higher gasification rate of 65.09% compared to other groups, while its process parameters showed some deficiency regarding the stability of digestion, especially for low biochemical methane potential (BMP), which was not beneficial for the actual practice. A T4 reactor, with a highest gasification rate of 70.68%, held the maximum BMP (497.44 mL/g VS). The stable chemical parameters achieved the optimal proportion, consisting of 40% carbohydrates, 40% lipids, and 20% protein. Furthermore, its microbial populations were rich and achieved a balance of the two main dominant communities of acetoclastic methanogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, whose relative abundance was close. It was obvious that interactive effects were caused by different proportional composition, which led to constantly changing chemical parameters and microbial community."
209,"title:Optimisation and Modelling of Anaerobic Digestion of Whiskey Distillery/Brewery Wastes after Combined Chemical and Mechanical Pre-Treatment,abstract:Whiskey distillery waste streams consisting of pot ale (liquid residue) and spent grain (solid residue) are high strength organic wastes and suitable feedstock for anaerobic digestion (AD) from both economic and environmental stand points. Anaerobic digestion of pot ale and pot ale/spent grain mixtures (with mixing ratios of 1:1, 1:3, and 1:5 by wet weight) was performed after implementation of a novel hybrid pre-treatment (combined chemical and mechanical) in order to modify lignocellulosic structure and ultimately enhance digestion yield. Lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose fractions were determined before and after chemical pre-treatment. Effects of different inoculum rates (10–30–50% on wet basis) and beating times (0–7.5–15 min) on anaerobic digestion of pot ale alone and of pot ale/spent grain mixtures were investigated in lab scale batch mode with a major focus of optimising biogas yield by using response surface methodology (RSM) in Design Expert Software. The highest biogas yields of 629  8.5 mL/g vs. (51.3% CH4) and 360  10 mL/g vs. (55.0  0.4) with anaerobic digestion of pot ale alone and spent grain mix after 1M NaOH and 7.5 min beating pre-treatments with 50% inoculum ratio respectively. The optimum digestion conditions to maximise the biogas quality and quantity were predicted as 10 and 13 min beating times and 32 and 38 C digestion temperatures for anaerobic digestion of pot ale alone and spent grain mix respectively."

212,"title:Life Cycle Assessment of the Mesophilic, Thermophilic, and Temperature-Phased Anaerobic Digestion of Sewage Sludge,abstract:In this study the environmental impact of the anaerobic digestion (AD) of sewage sludge within an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was investigated. Three alternative AD systems (mesophilic, thermophilic, and temperature-phased anaerobic digestion (TPAD)) were compared to determine which system may have the best environmental performance. Two life cycle assessments (LCA) were performed considering: (i) the whole WWTP (for a functional unit (FU) of 1 m3 of treated wastewater), and (ii) the sludge line (SL) alone (for FU of 1 m3 of produced methane). The data for the LCA were obtained from previous laboratory experimental work in combination with full-scale WWTP and literature. According to the results, the WWTP with TPAD outperforms those with mesophilic and thermophilic AD in most analyzed impact categories (i.e., Human toxicity, Ionizing radiation, Metal and Fossil depletion, Agricultural land occupation, Terrestrial acidification, Freshwater eutrophication, and Ozone depletion), except for Climate change where the WWTP with mesophilic AD performed better than with TPAD by 7%. In the case of the SL alone, the production of heat and electricity (here accounted for as avoided environmental impacts) led to credits in most of the analyzed impact categories except for Human toxicity where credits did not balance out the impacts caused by the wastewater treatment system. The best AD alternative was thermophilic concerning all environmental impact categories, besides Climate change and Human toxicity. Differences between both LCA results may be attributed to the FU."

It is considered a useful technology for the generation of renewable energy, and provides means to alleviate problems associated with low access to energy. However, a great deal of current research is targeted towards the optimization of this technology under diverse digestion process conditions. This review presents an in-depth analysis of the chemistry of anaerobic digestion and discusses how process chemistry can be used to optimize system performance through identification of methods that can accelerate syntrophic interactions of different microorganisms for improved methanogenic reactions. Recent advances in addition to old research are discussed in order to offer a general but comprehensive synopsis of accumulated knowledge in the theory of anaerobic digestion, as well as an overview of previous research and future directions and opportunities of the AD technology. Achieving a sustainable energy system requires comprehensive reforms in not just economic, social and policy aspects, but also in all technical aspects, which represents one of the most crucial future investments for anaerobic digestion systems."

The present research aimed to compare anaerobic digestion with olive pomace oil extraction, by using life cycle assessment, as alternatives for the valorization of the olive mill solid waste generated in the centrifugation process with a two-outlet decanter from oil mills. In the case of olive pomace oil extraction, two cases were defined depending on the type of fuel used for drying the wet pomace before the extraction: natural gas or a fraction of the generated extracted pomace. The anaerobic digestion alternative consisted of the production of biogas from the olive mill solid waste, heat and electricity cogeneration by the combustion of the generated biogas, and composting of the anaerobic digestate. The life cycle assessment showed that anaerobic digestion was the best alternative, with a global environmental impact reduction of 88.1 and 85.9% respect to crude olive pomace oil extraction using natural gas and extracted pomace, respectively, as fuel."
220,"title:Anaerobic Digestion of Steam-Exploded Wheat Straw and Co-Digestion Strategies for Enhanced Biogas Production,abstract:Wheat straw (WS) is considered a favourable substrate for biogas production. However, due to its rigid structure and high carbon to nitrogen (C/N ratio), its biodegradability during anaerobic digestion (AD) is usually low. In the present study, the effect of steam explosion pre-treatment on WS, combined with C/N adjustment with inorganic nitrogen, on biogas production was evaluated. Additionally, co-digestion of WS with protein-rich agri-industrial by-products (dried distillers’ grains with solubles (DDGS) and rapeseed meal (RM)) was assessed. Steam explosion enhanced biogas production from WS, whereas the addition of NH4Cl was beneficial (p < 0.05) for the digestion of steam-exploded wheat straw (SE). Furthermore, mono-digestion of the four different substrates seemed to be efficient in both inoculum to substrate ratios (I/S) tested (3.5 and 1.75 (w/w)). Finally, during co-digestion of WS and SE with DDGS and RM, an increase in the cumulative methane production was noted when higher amounts of DDGS and RM were co-digested. This study demonstrated that DDGS and RM can be used as an AD supplement to stimulate gas production and improve wheat straw biodegradability, while their addition at 10% on an AD system operating with WS can enhance gas yields at levels similar to those achieved by steam-exploded straw."

222,"title:A Preliminary Study of the Effect of Bioavailable Fe and Co on the Anaerobic Digestion of Rice Straw,abstract:Rice straw is an abundant and sustainable substrate for anaerobic digestion (AD), but it is often deficient in essential trace elements (TEs) for proper microbial growth and metabolism. A lack of TEs leads to AD imbalances and suboptimal biogas yields. However, the total TE concentration is not a sufficient indicator of the amount of TEs available to the microorganisms. Therefore, this study investigated the degree of bioavailability of iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co) during the AD of rice straw, and correlated it to the biomethane yields and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) produced. When the two TEs were dosed at 205 g Fe/g TS and 18 g Co/g TS of rice straw, the biomethane production was approximately 260 mL CH4/g VS, i.e., similar to that obtained when Fe and Co were not added. Despite an increased bioavailable fraction of 23 and 48% for Fe and Co, respectively, after TEs addition, the AD performance was not enhanced. Moreover, VFAs did not exceed 250 mg HAc/L both in the presence and absence of added TEs, confirming no enhancement of the methanogenesis step. Therefore, the bioavailability of Fe and Co was not a limiting factor for the biomethane production at low total VFAs concentration."

The efficiency of these pretreatments on both ammonia removal—recovering ammonia salts to be used as fertilizers in agriculture—and the increase of methane production were assessed in batch tests. Since the pH, temperature, and air flow rate heavily influence AS efficiency and the composition of treated SW, these parameters were set individually or in combination. In more detail, the pH was increased from the natural value of SW to 8 or 10, temperature was increased from the room value to 40 C, and the air flow rate was increased from zero to 5 Lair LSW-1 min-1. AS was generally more efficient at removing ammonia (up to 97%) from raw (non-treated) SW compared to the other treatments. However, the tested pretreatments were not as efficient as expected in increasing the biogas production, because the methane yields of all pretreated substrates were lower (by about 10–50%) to compared raw SW. The inhibitory effect on AD could have been due to the lack of nutrients and organic matter in the substrate (due to the excessive removal of the pretreatments), the concentration of toxic compounds (such as metal ions or furfural due to water evaporation), and an excess of alkali ions (used to increase the pH in AS). Overall, AS can be considered a sustainable process for the recovery of ammonium sulphate and the removal of other polluting compounds (e.g., organic matter) from SW. Conversely, the use of AS and other chemical and/or thermal processes tested in this study as pretreatments of SW before AD is not advised because these processes appear to reduce methane yields."

229,"title:Numerical Comparison of a Combined Hydrothermal Carbonization and Anaerobic Digestion System with Direct Combustion of Biomass for Power Production,abstract:Two of the methods for converting biomass to fuel are hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and anaerobic digestion (AD). This study is aimed at designing and analyzing two scenarios for bioenergy production from undervalued biomass (sawdust). In one of the scenarios (direct combustion or DC), raw biomass is burned in a combustor to provide the heat that is required by the Rankine cycle to generate electricity. In the other scenario (HTC-AD), the raw biomass first undergoes HTC treatment. While the solid product (hydrochar) is used to produce power by a Rankine cycle, the liquid by-product undergoes an AD process. This results in fuel gas production and it can be used in a Brayton cycle to generate more power. Energy and mass balance analysis of both scenarios were developed for each unit process by using Engineering Equation Solver (EES). The required data were obtained experimentally or from the literature. The performances of the proposed systems were evaluated, and a sensitivity analysis was presented to help in finding the best operational conditions."
230,"title:Improving Anaerobic Digestion of Sewage Sludge by Hydrogen Addition: Analysis of Microbial Populations and Process Performance,abstract:The effect of hydrogen pulse addition on digestion performance of sewage sludge was evaluated as a means for studying the increase in efficiency of methane production. Microbial communities were also evaluated to get an insight of the changes caused by the operational modifications of the digester. An energy evaluation of this alternative was performed considering the theoretical process of coupling bioelectrochemical systems (BES) for the treatment of wastewater along with hydrogen production and the subsequent anaerobic digestion. The addition of hydrogen to sewage sludge digestion resulted in an increase of 12% in biogas production over the control (1353 mL CH4 d-1 at an injection flow rate of 1938 mL H2 d-1). The liquid phase of the sludge reactor and the H2 supplemented one did not show significant differences, thus indicating that the application of hydrogen as the co-substrate was not detrimental. High-throughput sequencing analysis showed slight changes in archaeal relative abundance after hydrogen addition, whereas eubacterial community structure and composition revealed noteworthy shifts. The mass and energy balance indicated that the amount of hydrogen obtained from a hypothetical BES can be assimilated in the sludge digester, improving biogas production, but this configuration was not capable of covering all energy needs under the proposed scenario."
231,"title:Mesophilic and Thermophilic Anaerobic Digestion of Organic Fraction Separated during Mechanical Heat Treatment of Municipal Waste,abstract:The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of process temperature on semi-continuous anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction separated during autoclaving of municipal waste. Tests were carried out in reactors with full mixing. Biogas production was higher in thermophilic conditions than in mesophilic conditions (0.92 L/g volatile solids at 55 C vs. 0.42 L/g volatile solids at 37 C, respectively). The resulting methane yields were 0.25-0.32 L CH4/g VS and 0.56–0.70 L CH4/g VS in mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, respectively. In both variants, the methane share was over 70% v/v. This work also discusses the potential impact of Maillard compounds on the efficiency of the fermentation process, which were probably produced during the process of autoclaving of municipal waste. These results indicate that, after autoclaving, the organic fraction of municipal waste can be an effective substrate for anaerobic digestion in thermophilic conditions."

233,"title:Effect of Clinoptilolite and Halloysite Addition on Biogas Production and Microbial Community Structure during Anaerobic Digestion,abstract:The study presents a comparison of the influence of a clinoptilolite-rich rock—zeolite (commonly used for improving anaerobic digestion processes)—and a highly porous clay mineral, halloysite (mainly used for gas purification), on the biogas production process. Batch experiments showed that the addition of each mineral increased the efficiency of mesophilic anaerobic digestion of both sewage sludge and maize silage. However, halloysite generated 15% higher biogas production during maize silage transformation. Halloysite also contributed to a much higher reduction of chemical oxygen demand for both substrates (by ~8% for maize silage and ~14% for sewage sludge) and a higher reduction of volatile solids and total ammonia for maize silage (by ~8% and ~4%, respectively). Metagenomic analysis of the microbial community structure showed that the addition of both mineral sorbents influenced the presence of key members of archaea and bacteria occurring in a well-operated biogas reactor. The significant difference between zeolite and halloysite is that the latter promoted the immobilization of key methanogenic archaea Methanolinea (belong to Methanomicrobia class). Based on this result, we postulate that halloysite could be useful not only as a sorbent for (bio)gas treatment methodologies but also as an agent for improving biogas production."

WWTPs treat both municipal and industrial wastewater influents, resulting in the production of biosolids after digestion. Biogas, a potential recovered alternative energy source, is also produced as an output from successful anaerobic digestion. More than 7M of dry tons/year of biosolids produced in the US are most often disposed in either landfills or land-applied (~80%). These options are becoming more challenging to implement due to increases in transportation costs and tipping fees, decreases in the availability of landfill/landfarm space, and most importantly, increased regulations. This situation is strongly encouraging WWTPs to find alternatives for the disposal of biosolids. Developing alternative management/disposal options for biosolids are evolving. One of the most attractive alternative option from a sustainability perspective are biorefineries (converts waste to commercial products), which are a fast-growing option given the push toward circular urban source economies (little to no waste generation). Anaerobic digestion has been widely applied in WWTPs to reduce the volume of activated sludge due to its low energy requirements, effective handling of fluctuations due to organic loading rate, relative flexibility with temperature and pH changes, and since biogas is produced that can be transformed into energy. Various pretreatment methods for waste sludges prior to digestion that have been studied to reduce solids production and increase the energetic content of the biogas are presented and discussed. Solids handling and management, which comprises ~60% of the operational cost of a WWTP, is estimated to save more than $100 M annually by achieving at least 20% reduction in the annual production of biosolids within the US. This review incorporates an assessment of various pretreatment methods to optimize the anaerobic digestion of waste sludges with a focus on maximizing both biosolids reduction and biogas quality."
239,"title:Enhanced Anaerobic Digestion by Stimulating DIET Reaction,abstract:Since the observation of direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) in anaerobic mixed cultures in 2010s, the topic “DIET-stimulation” has been the main route to enhance the performance of anaerobic digestion (AD) under harsh conditions, such as high organic loading rate (OLR) and the toxicants’ presence. In this review article, we tried to answer three main questions: (i) What are the merits and strategies for DIET stimulation? (ii) What are the consequences of stimulation? (iii) What is the mechanism of action behind the impact of this stimulation? Therefore, we introduced DIET history and recent relevant findings with a focus on the theoretical advantages. Then, we reviewed the most recent articles by categorizing how DIET reaction was stimulated by adding conductive material (CM) and/or applying external voltage (EV). The emphasis was made on the enhanced performance (yield and/or production rate), CM type, applied EV, and mechanism of action for each stimulation strategy. In addition, we explained DIET-caused changes in microbial community structure. Finally, future perspectives and practical limitations/chances were explored in detail. We expect this review article will provide a better understanding for DIET pathway in AD and encourage further research development in a right direction."

These changes can alter handling of manure during downstream operations. This study analyzed the density, total solids (TS) content, and volatile solids (VS) content of pre-digested and anaerobically digested dairy manure from seven dairy farms in Wisconsin. The density of pre-digested manure increased from 990 to 1065 kg m-3 as the TS level increased from 1.5% to 13.0%. Density and TS for pre-digested manure from facilities using separated solids as bedding were related with a linear model for TS ranging from 1.5% to 13.0% and with a polynomial model for TS ranging from 1.5% to 50%. The model shows that density decreases with an increasing TS content when TS is greater than 8.0%. Manure from dairy facilities that used sand bedding had a VS/TS ratio of 0.87. This ratio was higher than the ratio when manure solids were used as bedding (0.81) and when food waste was incorporated into the digester (0.77). This study also provides a simple methodology to estimate biogas yield by using the density of pre- and post-digested manure."

The results indicated that the use of iron as anode and cathode is the most suitable solution among different electrode combinations. The reduction of turbidity, total chemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus, total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Enterococci, and phages in the reclaimed water were 99%, 91%, 100%, 1.5 log, 1.7 log, 1.0 log, and 2.0 log, respectively. The economic assessment further concluded that the average treatment cost is $3 per 1000 L for a small-scale operation handling 3000 L wastewater/day. This study demonstrated that the electrocoagulation (EC) is a promising technique for the recovery and reclamation of water from anaerobic digestion effluent. Even though its energy consumption is higher and the nitrogen removal is insufficient compared to some conventional wastewater treatment technologies, there are several advantages of the EC treatment, such as short retention time, small footprint, no mixing, and gradual addition of coagulants. These features make EC technology applicable to be used alone or combined with other technologies for a wide range of wastewater treatment applications."

However, wine lees are a complex substrate and may likely give rise to instabilities leading to failure of the biological process. This work analysed the digestion of wine lees using two different approaches. First, electro-oxidation was applied as pre-treatment using boron-doped diamond-based electrodes. The voltage was 25 V and different treatment times were tested (ranging from 0.08 to 1.5 h) at 25 C. Anaerobic digestion of wine lees was evaluated in batch tests to investigate the effect of electro-oxidation on biogas yield. Electro-oxidation exhibited a significant positive effect on biogas production increasing its value up to 330 L kg-1 of volatile solids after 1.5 h of treatment, compared to 180 L kg-1 of volatile solids measured from raw wine lees. As a second approach, the addition of biochar to the anaerobic digestion of wine lees was investigated; in the experimental conditions considered in the present study, the addition of biochar did not show any positive effect on anaerobic digestion performance."

246,"title:High-Solids Anaerobic Digestion Followed by Ultrasonication of Digestate and Wet-Type Anaerobic Digestion for Enhancing Methane Yield from OFMSW,abstract:High-solids anaerobic digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste often shows inefficient biomethane recovery due to mass transfer limitations. Consequently, this study presents a two-stage anaerobic digestion process combining high-solids anaerobic digestion followed by ultrasonication of digestate and wet-type anaerobic digestion for effective biomethane recovery from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste. The high-solids anaerobic digestion yielded methane production of 210 L CH4/kg volatile solids (VS). The digestate from the high-solids anaerobic digestion process was ultrasonicated at three different specific energy inputs (1000, 2500, and 5000 kJ/kg total solids (TS)). The increases in the soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) concentrations (8%–32%) and volatile solids (VS) removal efficiencies (3.5%–10%) at different specific energy inputs were linearly correlated (R2 = 0.9356). Thus, ultrasonication led to the solubilization of particulate organics and released soluble organic matters. All ultrasonicated digestate samples showed significantly higher biomethane yields than that observed for the untreated digestate samples. The highest methane yield of 132 L CH4/kg VS was observed for a specific energy input of 5000 kJ/kg TS, which was 1.94 times higher than the control (68 L CH4/kg VS). Although specific energy inputs of 1000 kJ/kg TS and 2500 kJ/kg TS showed comparable methane yields (113–114 L CH4/kg VS), they were ~1.67 times higher than the control. Overall, our results suggest that an integrated system of high-solids and wet-type anaerobic digestion with pre-ultrasonication of digestate has the potential to provide a technically viable solution to enhance biomethane recovery from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste."
247,"title:High-Solids Anaerobic Digestion Followed by Ultrasonication of Digestate and Wet-Type Anaerobic Digestion for Enhancing Methane Yield from OFMSW,abstract:High-solids anaerobic digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste often shows inefficient biomethane recovery due to mass transfer limitations. Consequently, this study presents a two-stage anaerobic digestion process combining high-solids anaerobic digestion followed by ultrasonication of digestate and wet-type anaerobic digestion for effective biomethane recovery from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste. The high-solids anaerobic digestion yielded methane production of 210 L CH4/kg volatile solids (VS). The digestate from the high-solids anaerobic digestion process was ultrasonicated at three different specific energy inputs (1000, 2500, and 5000 kJ/kg total solids (TS)). The increases in the soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) concentrations (8%–32%) and volatile solids (VS) removal efficiencies (3.5%–10%) at different specific energy inputs were linearly correlated (R2 = 0.9356). Thus, ultrasonication led to the solubilization of particulate organics and released soluble organic matters. All ultrasonicated digestate samples showed significantly higher biomethane yields than that observed for the untreated digestate samples. The highest methane yield of 132 L CH4/kg VS was observed for a specific energy input of 5000 kJ/kg TS, which was 1.94 times higher than the control (68 L CH4/kg VS). Although specific energy inputs of 1000 kJ/kg TS and 2500 kJ/kg TS showed comparable methane yields (113–114 L CH4/kg VS), they were ~1.67 times higher than the control.

248,"title:An Assessment of Different Integration Strategies of Hydrothermal Carbonisation and Anaerobic Digestion of Water Hyacinth,abstract:Water hyacinth (WH) is an invasive aquatic macrophyte that dominates freshwater bodies across the world. However, due to its rapid growth rate and wide-spread global presence, WH could offer great potential as a biomass feedstock, including for bioenergy generation. This study compares different integration strategies of hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) and anaerobic digestion (AD) using WH, across a range of temperatures. These include (i) hydrochar combustion and process water digestion, (ii) hydrochar digestion, (iii) slurry digestion. HTC reactions were conducted at 150 C, 200 C, and 250 C. Separation of hydrochars for combustion and process waters for digestion offers the most energetically-feasible valorisation route. However, hydrochars produced from WH display slagging and fouling tendencies; limiting their use in large-scale combustion. AD of WH slurry produced at 150 C appears to be energetically-feasible and has the potential to also be a viable integration strategy between HTC and AD, using WH."

251,"title:Struvite Precipitation for Sustainable Recovery of Nitrogen and Phosphorus from Anaerobic Digestion Effluents of Swine Manure,abstract:In this study, we propose the application of struvite precipitation for the sustainable recovery of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from anaerobic digestion (AD) effluents derived from swine manure. The optimal conditions for four major factors that affect the recovery of N and P were derived by conducting batch experiments on AD effluents obtained from four AD facilities. The optimal conditions were a pH of 10.0, NH4-N:Mg:PO4-P molar ratio of 1:1.4:1, mixing intensity of 240 s-1, and mixing duration of 2 min. Under these optimal conditions, the removal efficiencies of NH4-N and PO4-P were approximately 74% and 83%, respectively, whereas those of Cu and Zn were approximately 74% and 79%, respectively. Herein, a model for swine manure treatment that incorporates AD, struvite precipitation, and biological treatment processes is proposed. We applied this model to 85 public biological treatment facilities in South Korea and recovered 4722 and 51 tons/yr of NH4-N and PO4-P, respectively. The economic analysis of the proposed model’s performance predicts a lack of profitability due to the high cost of chemicals; however, this analysis does not consider the resulting protection of the hydrological environment. Field-scale studies should be conducted in future to prove the effectiveness of the model."
252,"title:Mesophilic Semi-Continuous Anaerobic Digestion of Strawberry Extrudate Pretreated with Steam Explosion,abstract:The production of strawberry concentrate produces a side stream after extrusion that is commonly landfilled. This strawberry extrudate (SE), of lignocellulosic character, contains valuable bioactive compounds such as sugars and phenols. Thermal treatments, such as steam explosion, are currently used for the valorisation of agricultural lignocellulosic wastes due to their ability to impact the structure of the lignocellulose and hemicellulose present in these wastes, favouring the disruption of fibrous material. Steam explosion has already been shown as a promising technology for phenol recovery from SE. Biogas is an additional valuable resource that might be produced from thermally pretreated and de-phenolised SE. This study assessed the influence of a steam-explosion pretreatment and the subsequent recovery of phenolic compounds from the long-term operation of a semi-continuous anaerobic digester of pretreated SE. The anaerobic digestion of SE steam exploded at 220 C for 5 min and de-phenolised was stable at an OLR of 0.5 g of volatile solids (VS)/(Ld), which permitted a specific production rate of 135  11 mL of CH4/(g of VS d). The system was not able to operate at an OLR of 1 g of VS/(Ld), which resulted in a failure of the process. Despite the inhibition threshold of phenolic compounds not being achieved, the inhibition of the anaerobic digestion process at an OLR of 1 g of VS/(Ld) was most likely due to the overloading of the system. This was indicated by the accumulation of soluble organic matter and volatile fatty acids. The increase in the propionic acid concentration up to 1300 mg/L when operating at OLRs higher than 0.5 g of VS/(Ld) could be the main factor responsible for the inhibition. An economic evaluation showed that the proposed approach (steam explosion, phenol recovery, and anaerobic digestion) would offer positive benefits, taking into account the high phenolic recovery (0.90 g of gallic acid equivalents/kg of extrudate) and the low sales price of the phenol extract, i.e., EUR 0.610/g of gallic acid equivalents, needed to reach zero net profit."

The reactor temperature is considered as one of the most vital factors for the digestion process. An experiment was conducted in the Biogas Laboratory of Green Energy Knowledge Hub at Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) to examine the influence of temperature on anaerobic digestion of cow-dung. Laboratory-scale continuous stirred tank reactors with a working volume of 15 L were operated for a 30-day retention time. The reactors were set at 20 C, 25 C, 30 C, 35 C, 40 C and 45 C, respectively to determine the effect of temperature on anaerobic digestion performance. Different parameters like total solids, volatile solids, pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen, biogas production rate and methane concentration were examined. Among all the reactors, the reactor at 40 C temperature produced maximum biogas (312.43 L/kg VS) and methane yields (209.70 L/kg VS), followed by the reactors at 35 C and 30 C, respectively. Statistical analysis of the obtained experimental results using Minitab® showed that the optimum process performance in terms of methane yield and volatile solid degradation is achieved at a reactor temperature of 35.82 C."

258,"title:Process Optimisation of Anaerobic Digestion Treating High-Strength Wastewater in the Australian Red Meat Processing Industry,abstract:This work represents and reviews a compilation of investigations into improving anaerobic digestion performance of high-strength wastewater in the Australian Red Meat Processing industry. The industry produces significant quantities of organic-rich wastewater which requires treatment prior to release to the environment. Anaerobic lagoons are a cost-effective method of waste treatment where land availability is not an issue; however, the high fat load in the wastewater can negatively impact the anaerobic lagoon system and result in compromised anaerobic digestion performance. This paper will discuss the importance of upstream primary pre-treatment and review a series of investigations focused on optimising digester performance and improving fat biodegradability. These studies include: 1. the effect of temperature and mixing; 2. the influence of feedstock trace element composition and supplementation, and; 3. the potential benefit from pre-treatments such as chemical, thermobaric, thermochemical and bio-surfactant. This paper discusses the implications of these findings for covered anaerobic lagoon operation and provides recommendations to promote optimum digester performance and future opportunities in adopting alternate anaerobic digestion technology options. Finally, the paper provides recent trends toward the use of other waste streams for co-digestion and discusses this in terms of digester optimization and technology options."
259,"title:Coupling Hydrothermal Carbonization with Anaerobic Digestion for Sewage Sludge Treatment: Influence of HTC Liquor and Hydrochar on Biomethane Production,abstract:The present study addresses the coupling of hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) with anaerobic digestion (AD) in wastewater treatment plants. The improvement in biomethane production due to the recycling back to the anaerobic digester of HTC liquor and hydrochar generated from digested sludge is investigated and proved. Mixtures of different compositions of HTC liquor and hydrochar, as well as individual substrates, were tested. The biomethane yield reached 102  3 mL CH4 g-1 COD when the HTC liquor was cycled back to the AD and treated together with primary and secondary sludge. Thus, the biomethane production was almost doubled compared to that of the AD of primary and secondary sludge (55  20 mL CH4 g-1 COD). The benefit is even more significant when both the HTC liquor and the hydrochar were fed to the AD of primary and secondary sludge. The biomethane yield increased up to 187  18 mL CH4 g-1 COD when 45% of hydrochar, with respect to the total feedstock, was added. These results highlight the improvement that the HTC process can bring to AD, enhancing biomethane production and promoting a sustainable solution for the treatment of the HTC liquor and possibly the hydrochar itself."

The aerobic granular sludge (AGS) method, which has been developed for several years, may represent an alternative to traditional technologies. One of the barriers to AGS deployment is the limited knowledge on the determinants and efficiency of the anaerobic digestion (AD) of AGS, as little research has been devoted to it. Therefore, the aim of the present paper is to summarize the current state of knowledge on the subject, including a review of technological conditions, process performance, and AGS parameters that can impact AD, and currently used pre-treatment methods. The anaerobic stabilization performance of AGS is compared against conventional activated sludge (CAS). The paper also identifies avenues for further research and practical implementations to further optimize the process and to determine whether AD is viable in full-scale plants."

458,"title:Anaerobic Digestion of Lignocellulosic Waste Materials,abstract:Nowadays, the climate mitigation policies of EU promote the energy production based on renewable resources. Anaerobic digestion (AD) constitutes a biochemical process that can convert lignocellulosic materials into biogas, used for chemical products isolation or energy production, in the form of electricity, heat or fuels. Such practices are accompanied by several economic, environmental and climatic benefits. The method of AD is an effective method of utilization of several different low-value and negative-cost highly available materials of residual character, such as the lignocellulosic wastes coming from forest, agricultural or marine biomass utilization processes, in order to convert them into directly usable energy. Lignin depolymerization remains a great challenge for the establishment of a full scale process for AD of lignin waste. This review analyzes the method of anaerobic digestion (biomethanation), summarizes the technology and standards involved, the progress achieved so far on the depolymerization/pre-treatment methods of lignocellulosic bio-wastes and the respective residual byproducts coming from industrial processes, aiming to their conversion into energy and the current attempts concerning the utilization of the produced biogas. Substrates’ mechanical, physical, thermal, chemical, and biological pretreatments or a combination of those before biogas production enhance the hydrolysis stage efficiency and, therefore, biogas generation. AD systems are immensely expanding globally, especially in Europe, meeting the high demands of humans for clean energy."

465,"title:Anaerobic Digestion of Municipal Sewage Sludge Integrated with Brewery Wastewater Treatment: Importance of Temperature and Mixing Ratio,abstract:Brewery wastewater is characterized by a high organic matter content and low pH, which may cause serious ecological hazards if it is discharged without any treatment. In this study, brewery wastewater treatment was integrated with anaerobic digestion of municipal sewage sludge. Additionally, the effects of temperature and mixing ratio of brewery wastewater were investigated. The results showed that the brewery wastewater mixing ratio (v/v) of 20% could maximize the biogas production during anaerobic digestion at the temperature of 34 C. Additionally, regulating the appropriate mixing ratio, increasing operating temperature and adjusting pH were effective ways to enhance anaerobic digestion efficiency. Furthermore, the distribution of microbial communities was confirmed to be significantly influenced by the mixing ratio of brewery wastewater using high-throughput DNA sequencing technology. With the increasing mixing ratio of brewery wastewater, Firmicutes gradually dominated instead of Chloroflexi. Meanwhile, Methanolinea and Methanosarcina became the dominant methanogens, while the proportion of Methanothrix was significantly reduced. The results of this study will provide data to support the practical process operation of anaerobic co-digestion of brewery wastewater and municipal sewage sludge."

The aim of this study is to assess the technical feasibility of poultry waste AD in semi-continuous mode and to intensify methane production by co-digestion with physico-chemical sludge, i.e., the product of the primary treatment of wastewater after the slaughtering process. First, the AD of poultry droppings is conducted in a continuous stirred anaerobic digester (CSAD) at 37 C. A volume of 0.791 and 0.623 Nm3Nm-3 reactordays-1 of biogas and methane, respectively, were produced during the entire process stabilization period. Biochemical characterization of the substrate and the final digestate show high reduction rates of the biochemical fractions, which corroborates with methane yield. In addition, the co-digestion of poultry droppings with two different ratios of physico-chemical sludge (20% and 40% added sludge considering the amount of volatile solids) shows an increase in methane production versus droppings alone, with a higher increase of 54% with a sludge ratio of 40%. Altogether, these promising results were obtained in stable processes, highlighting the pertinence of our study."

The results showed that total concentrations of As generally decreased by 33–71% after AD. Further analysis showed that the As species of the dissolved fractions were present mainly as dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), with arsenite (As(III)) and arsenate (As(V)) as the minor species. Moreover, real-time PCR (qPCR) results showed that As metabolism genes (arsC, arsenate reduction gene; aioA, arsenite oxidation gene and arsM, arsenite methylation gene) were highly abundant, with arsM being predominant among the metabolism genes. This study provides reliable evidence on As biotransformation in swine wastewater treatment process, suggesting that AD could be a valuable treatment to mitigate the risk of As in wastewater."

555,"title:Beneficial Microorganisms in the Anaerobic Digestion of Cattle and Swine Excreta,abstract:The accumulation of solid organic waste is reaching critical levels in almost all regions of the world. It must be managed sustainably to avoid the depletion of natural resources, minimize risks to human health, reduce environmental burdens, and maintain an overall balance in the ecosystem. This research focuses on the anaerobic digestion of bovine and swine excreta with and without applying beneficial microorganisms as a viable option for recycling agricultural solid wastes. Three greenhouse gases (GHGs)—methane, carbon dioxide, and ammonia—produced by cattle and swine excreta that were treated with and without beneficial microorganisms in bioreactors were quantified. A monitoring and gas concentration measurement system was implemented inside the bioreactors. The behavior of the GHGs and the efficiency of the beneficial microorganisms in treating the farm animal waste were analyzed according to the phases of anaerobic digestion. Average reductions in the concentration in units of ppm of CH4 during the composting process of 46.95% and 34.48% were observed for the cattle and swine excreta treatments, respectively. It was concluded that the studied GHGs had different behaviors in the anaerobic digestion of the treatments in cattle and swine excreta with and without beneficial microorganisms due to the different types of feeding. However, it must be emphasized that beneficial microorganisms are an essential tool for reducing GHGs in anaerobic digestion."

577,"title:Biochemical Methane Potential Assays for Organic Wastes as an Anaerobic Digestion Feedstock,abstract:The anaerobic digestion process is applied worldwide in the treatment of various organic wastes, allowing energy production from biogas and organic recovery from digested sludge. In the evaluation of suitable substrates for anaerobic digestion, Biochemical Methane Potential assays are the most applied, and, despite several efforts to standardize this method, it is observed that there are still several studies that do not apply all the criteria. This current paper’s main goal is to present a review of anaerobic feedstocks, BMP methodologies, experimental conditions, and results of specific methane production from 2008 to 2023. A wide range of anaerobic feedstocks was found, which was divided into five groups: animal manure, sludge, food wastes, energy crops, and other organic wastes. Several parameters were used to characterize the anaerobic feedstocks, like TS, VS, COD, and pH, displaying different value ranges. The number of publications concerning BMP assays increased significantly over the years until 2021, having stabilized in the last two years. This evolution allowed for several attempts to standardize the BMP method with positive developments, but there are still some gaps in the experimental conditions and the determination of specific methane production. All of this makes the comparison of some studies a challenge."

For proper operation of anaerobic digesters, an efficient mixing provides a relatively homogenous mixture of the feedstock within the tank. This study aims to investigate the mixing process and the total energy consumption needed for stirring by using an asymmetrical mixer. A further objective is to analyze the formation of stagnant volume and the velocity gradient in the digester in order to assure the mixing efficiency of the mixer type. The computational model is implemented as the finite volume method, and the rheological properties of the feedstock are considered. The results are validated by comparing the on-site power consumption of the mixer with the values obtained by the numerical torque. At various mixer speeds, the dead volume does not exceed 0.5% of the digester tank; however, with the increase of the mixer rotation speed, the energy consumption of the mixer increases drastically."

813,"title:Optimization of Operating Parameters for Two-Phase Anaerobic Digestion Treating Slaughterhouse Wastewater for Biogas Production: Focus on Hydrolytic–Acidogenic Phase,abstract:In a two-phase anaerobic digestion process, enhanced biogas production and organic pollutant removal depend on the stability and performance of the hydrolytic–acidogenic and methanogenic phases. Additionally, the hydrolytic–acidogenic phase is a rate-limiting step, which calls for the further optimization of operating parameters. The objective of this study was to optimize the operating parameters of the hydrolytic–acidogenic reactor (HR) in the two-phase anaerobic digestion treating slaughterhouse wastewater. The experiment was carried using bench-scale sequential bioreactors. The hydrolytic–acidogenic reactor operating parameters were optimized for six different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) (6–1 day) and organic loading rates (OLRs) (894.41  32.56–5366.43  83.80 mg COD/L*day). The degree of hydrolysis and acidification were mainly influenced by lower HRT (higher OLR), and the highest values of hydrolysis and acidification were 63.92% and 53.26% at an HRT of 3 days, respectively. The findings indicated that, at steady state, the concentrations of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) and total volatile fatty acids (TVFAs) decrease as HRT decreases and OLR increases from HRTs of 3 to 1 day and 894.41–1788.81 mg COD/L*day, respectively, and increase as the HRT decreases from 6 to 4 days. The concentration of NH4+-N ranges from 278.67 to 369.46 mg/L, which is not in the range that disturbs the performance and stability of the hydrolytic acidogenic reactor. It was concluded that an HRT of 3 days and an ORL of 1788.81 mg COD/L*day were selected as optimal operating conditions for the high performance and stability of the two-phase anaerobic digestion of slaughterhouse wastewater in the hydrolytic–acidogenic reactor at a mesophilic temperature. The findings of this study can be applicable for other agro-process industry wastewater types with similar characteristics and biowaste for value addition and sustainable biowaste management and safe discharge."

This study was conducted using a bioreactor design with and without electrodes (conventional condition). Measurements of pH, redox potential (ORP), and total dissolved solids were carried out, as was the microscopy of activated sludge during treatment and gasometry. There was an increase in the yields of CH4 and CO2 compared to conventional conditions. Thus, on the 14th day, there was an increase in the CH4 yield to 35.1% compared with the conventional conditions—31.6%—as well as in the CO2 yield to 53.5% compared with the cell without electrodes—37.7%. Visually, the microscopy of anaerobic activated sludge showed changes in the aggregation process itself, with the formation of cells of clusters of microorganism colonies with branches of a delineated shape. ORP fluctuations were related to the process of the dissociation into ions during the passage of an electric current through the electrodes, and were observed before and after the inclusion of a current into the system. A model of the effect of electrolysis during anaerobic digestion was developed, taking into account the influencing factors on the condition of the activated sludge."

959,"title:Effects of Different Materials on Biogas Production during Anaerobic Digestion of Food Waste,abstract:One of the best methods for turning different types of biomass into clean energy is anaerobic digestion (AD). Organic and inorganic additives may be employed in the AD process to increase biogas output. It has been demonstrated that inorganic additives, such as micronutrients, can improve the efficiency of biogas producing reactors. These trace items can be introduced to the AD process as powders. The use of metal oxides in engineering and environmental research has become more popular. This study focuses on the role of TiO2 and ZnO/Ag powders on anaerobic digestion. Food waste studies on biochemical methane potential were performed with and without TiO2 and ZnO/Ag powders to examine their impact on AD. All powders are grown through the hydrothermal procedure, which has proved to be environmentally friendly and low in cost, presenting the capability to simply control the materials’ characteristics at mild temperatures. The addition of ZnO/Ag and TiO2 improved the biogas cumulative yield by 12 and 44%, respectively, compared to the control reactor. In addition, volatile solids (VS) removal efficiency increased by 5.7% in the food wastes (FW) and TiO2 reactor, while total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal efficiency increased by 22% after the addition of ZnO/Ag."

974,"title:Effects of Lighter Dose of Oxytetracycline on the Accumulation and Degradation of Volatile Fatty Acids in the Process of Thermophilic Anaerobic Digestion of Swine Manure,abstract:Oxytetracycline (OTC) is a commonly used antibiotic in livestock farming for controlling intestinal and respiratory infections in farm animals. However, the absorption of antibiotics by animals is limited, and most antibiotics are excreted in the original form with manure, which will have an impact on the environment. The removal of antibiotics from swine manure could generally be performed via anaerobic digestion (AD). In this study, the effect of oxytetracycline (OTC) at doses of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/L on the thermophilic anaerobic digestion of swine manure (55 C) in batch digesters was studied. The methane production, volatile fatty acid (VFA) levels, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) were determined and compared with the control (0 mg/L of OTC). The results indicate that (1) OTC at 0.1 mg/L had no inhibitory effect on methane production or on the accumulation of VFAs, while 0.5 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L inhibited methane production, with inhibition rates of 4.03% and 14.12% (p < 0.05), respectively; (2) the VFAs of each reactor peaked on the first day of the reaction, and as the OTC dose increased from 0 to 1.0 mg/L, the maximum VFA accumulation increased from 1346.94 mg/g to 2370 mg/g of volatile solids (VS); and (3) oxytetracycline (0.5 and 1.0 mg/L) could promote the temporary accumulation of propionic acid, which did, however, not result in significant VFA accumulation. Further, OTC at 1.0 mg/L can promote DOM production, and therefore, VFA accumulation."

1013,"title:Energetic Valorization of Wet Olive Mill Wastes through a Suitable Integrated Treatment: H2O2 with Lime and Anaerobic Digestion,abstract:In the Mediterranean region, the disposal of residues of olive oil industries represents an important environmental issue. In recent years, many techniques were proposed to improve the characteristics of these wastes with the aim to use them for methane generation in anaerobic digestion processes. Nevertheless, these techniques, in many cases, result costly as well as difficult to perform. In the present work, a simple and useful process that exploits H2O2 in conjunction with lime is developed to enhance the anaerobic biodegradability of wet olive mill wastes (WMOW). Several tests were performed to investigate the influence of lime amount and H2O2 addition modality. The treatment efficiency was positively affected by the increase of lime dosage and by the sequential addition of hydrogen peroxide. The developed process allows reaching phenols abatements up to 80% and volatile fatty acids productions up to 90% by using H2O2 and Ca(OH)2 amounts of 0.05 gH2O2/gCOD and 35 g/L, respectively. The results of many batch anaerobic digestion tests, carried out by means of laboratory equipment, proved that the biogas production from fresh wet olive mill wastes is hardly achievable. On the contrary, organic matter abatements, around to 78%, and great methane yields, up to 0.34–0.35 LCH4/gCODremoved, were obtained on pretreated wastes."

1016,"title:Energy Generation from Horse Husbandry Residues by Anaerobic Digestion, Combustion, and an Integrated Approach,abstract:Horse-related activities often occur close to urban areas, where acreage for horse manure disposal is scarce, and subsequently alternative recovery options are necessary. Anaerobic digestion, direct combustion, and the integrated generation of solid fuel and biogas from biomass (IFBB) process are potential techniques focusing on energy provision. In this study, samples of horse faeces were analysed for chemical composition as pure feedstock and in mixture with straw or wood shavings, as well as for energy yield by biogas production or from combustion of solid fuel. It was observed that chemical properties of faeces, in a mixture with wood shavings, were promising for direct combustion, but achieved low methane yields. The methane yield of pure faeces and the straw mixture was 222.33  13.60 and 233.01  31.32 lNkg-1 volatile solids (VS)added, respectively. The IFBB process divided the biomass into a press cake with reduced mineral concentration and a press fluid. Methane yields of press fluids were low (108.2 lNkg-1 VSadded, on average). The chemical composition of the press cake allowed for combustion and led to a higher gross energy potential than anaerobic digestion (two-fold higher for pure manure and the mixture with straw, and five-fold higher for the mixture with shavings). Consequently, the gross energy potential of IFBB is higher compared to anaerobic digestion, however it should be noted that local conditions might favour the implementation of anaerobic digestion."

1047,"title:Enhanced Mesophilic Anaerobic Digestion of Primary Sewage Sludge,abstract:Processing of the produced primary and secondary sludge during sewage treatment is demanding and requires considerable resources. Most common practices suggest the cotreatment of primary and secondary sludge starting with thickening and anaerobic digestion. The aim of this study is to investigate the anaerobic digestion of the primary sludge only and estimate its impact on sludge treatment and energy recovery. Within this context, the performance of the anaerobic digestion of primary sludge is explored and focused on practices to further enhance the methane production by using additives, e.g., a cationic polyelectrolyte and attapulgite. The results showed that the overall yield in methane production during anaerobic digestion of primary sludge alone was higher than that obtained by the anaerobic digestion of mixed primary and secondary sludge (up to 40%), while the addition of both organic polyelectrolyte and attapulgite enhanced further the production of methane (up to 170%). Attapulgite increased the hydrolysis rate of biosolids and produced relatively stabilized digestate, though of lower dewaterability. Moreover, the results suggest that single digestion of primary sludge may accomplish higher methane production capacities at lower digestors’ volume increasing their overall efficiency and productivity, while the produced digestates are of adequate quality for further utilization mainly in agricultural or energy sectors."

1097,"title:Enhancing Mesophilic Anaerobic Digestion of Waste-Activated Sludge through Heat Pretreatment and Kinetic Modeling,abstract:Sewage sludge is a useful raw material for the production of renewable energy due to its stable annual output. In this study, the enhancement of mesophilic anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge through heat pretreatment at 95 C for 30 min was tested in an anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor (hAMBBR). The sludge retention time was set at 20, 15, 10, and 5 days during 300 days of operation and compared to a traditional anaerobic continuous stirred tank reactor (AnCSTR) without pretreatment. Results of this research indicate that the digestion ratio of volatile soluble solids in the hAMBBR process could be improved by 50%, and the average conversion ratio of methane could be increased by 45%. When the sludge retention time (SRT) was shortened to 5 days, the methane production approached twice that of the contrast reactor. The expanded anaerobic digestion model, including activated sludge models, was utilized for operation simulation. The effect of sludge retention time (SRT) shortening on volatile suspended solids (VSS) digestibility and methane production was well reproduced with simulations. The research conclusion reveals the impact of pretreatment and reactor types on anaerobic digestion and provides the scientific basis for improving methane production and process efficiency in anaerobic digestion."

The nutrient recovery technologies from wastes through low-cost processes will improve the sustainability of the agricultural systems. This work aimed to assess the suitability of the gas-permeable membrane (GPM) technology to recover N from an anaerobic digestate and test the agronomic behaviour of the ammonium sulphate solution (ASS) obtained. About 62% of the total ammonia nitrogen removed from digestate using GPM was recovered, producing an ASS with 14,889  2324 mg N L-1, which was more than six-fold higher than in digestate. The ASS agronomic behaviour was evaluated by a pot experiment with triticale as a plant test for 34 days in a growth chamber. Compared with the triticale fertilised with the Hoagland solution (Hoag), the ASS provided significantly higher biomass production (+29% dry matter), N uptake (+22%), and higher N agronomic efficiency 3.80 compared with 1.81 mg DM mg-1N in Hoag, and a nitrogen fertiliser replacement value of 133%. These increases can be due to a biostimulant effect provided by the organic compounds of the ASS as assessed by the FT-Raman spectroscopy. The ASS can be considered a bio-based mineral N fertiliser with a biostimulant effect."

Experimental results showed that methanogenic activity decreased over time with storage, regardless of storage temperature. However, the rate at which the methanogenic activity decreased was two and five times slower at 4 C than at 22 and 37 C, respectively. The inoculum stored at 4 C and room temperature (22 C) maintained methanogenic activity close to that of fresh inoculum for 14 days (<10% difference). However, a storage temperature of 4 C is preferred because of the slower decrease in activity with lengthier storage time. From this research, it was concluded that inoculum storage time should generally be kept to a minimum, but that storage at 4 C could help maintain methanogenic activity for longer."

1299,"title:Impacts of Temperature and Solids Retention Time, and Possible Mechanisms of Biological Hydrolysis Pretreatment on Anaerobic Digestion,abstract:Anaerobic digestion (AD) has benefits in sludge management, energy recovery, and  pathogen reduction. In order to better understand the mechanisms of biological hydrolysis (BH) pretreatment on AD, biochemical methane potential (BMP) and continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) tests were utilized to compare untreated municipal combined sludge with pilot-scale BH pretreated sludge. During the BH process, there was 15%, 30%, and 33% (w/w) volatile solids (VS) reduction after BH at 42 C (BH42) for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively; under BH61 (42 C for 36 h and 61 C for 6 h), and there was 10% and 30% (w/w) overall VS reduction after 36-h and 42-h hydrolysis, respectively. BMP results showed that BH42-pretreated sludge had 22.6% enhancement of methane yield compared to untreated sludge, and BH61 pretreated sludge had 29.4% enhancement of methane yield. Both temperature and solids’ retention time (SRT) contributed to the enhanced AD performance within 36 h, while temperature played more important roles after 36-h BH pretreatment. CSTR tests confirmed the acceleration of anaerobic digestion by BH pretreatment, and higher enhancement was observed when SRT of anaerobic digestion was shorter than 16 days. Through a literature review of BH-related studies, the possible mechanisms were highlighted for further optimization on the scale-up systems in order to reduce carbon footprint and operating expenditure for wastewater treatment plants."

1327,"title:Improvement of Biogas Production Using Biochar from Digestate at Different Pyrolysis Temperatures during OFMSW Anaerobic Digestion,abstract:Anaerobic digestion (AD) was utilized to treat the ever-growing amount of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) generated due to population growth and the expansion of the global economy. The widespread application of AD has led to a continuous increase in residual solid digestate that necessarily requires further disposal. Improving AD efficiency and reducing the large amount of digestate is necessary. This study investigated the chemical and physical characteristics of biochar derived from digestate at different pyrolysis temperatures (300 C, 500 C, and 700 C), as well as corn stover biochar at 500 C, and their effects on AD performance. The pH value of the biochar increased with an increase in pyrolysis temperature while the electrical conductivity decreased. Macropores dominated the biochar’s pore size, and decreased with an increased pyrolysis temperature. The biochar preparation temperature significantly influenced the AD efficiency. Biochar prepared at 700 C outperformed the other groups, improving the biogas production yields by 10.0%, effectively shortening the lag time, and increasing the average chemical oxygen demand (COD) degradation rate by 14.0%. The addition of biochar (700 C) and corn stover biochar increased the relative abundance of the volatile fatty acid (VFAs)-oxidizing bacteria Syntrophomonadaceae, which expedited the acid conversion in AD systems. Biochar facilitated direct interspecies electron transfer between DMER64 and Trichococcus with Methanosaeta, enhancing the biogas production performance. These findings confirmed that the biochar derived from digestate promoted biogas production and acid conversion in the AD system of OFMSW. Furthermore, biochar has an improved AD stability, which represents a promising approach to recycling digestate."

1330,"title:Improving Anaerobic Digestion of Brewery and Distillery Spent Grains through Aeration across a Silicone Membrane,abstract:An increase in the number of independent breweries and distilleries has led to an increase in the amount of spent grains with inadequate means of disposal. One option for disposal is as feedstock for anaerobic digestion if digester stability is ensured. In this study, brewers’ spent grain and distillers’ spent grain were used as substrate for anaerobic digestion for 32 weeks. The digestate was treated by recirculation through a silicone hose located in an external tank filled with saline solution. The hose served as a permeable membrane allowing for the passage of gases. The recirculation tanks were fitted with check valves to maintain three pressure/gas regimes: 26 mm Hg N2, 26 mm Hg aeration or 100 mm Hg aeration. A fourth digester was operated with no recirculation as the control. These treatments were chosen to determine if differences in digester stability, wastewater treatment efficiency, and biogas production could be detected. A combination of dairy and swine manure was used as seeding to provide a methanogenic consortium and bicarbonate buffering. However, despite trying to provide for adequate initial bicarbonate buffering, all four digesters had low initial buffering and consequently low pH as short-chain fatty acids accumulated. After six weeks, bicarbonate buffering and pH increased as methane production increased, and short-chain fatty acids decreased. Later, despite the fluxes of O2 and N2 across the silicone membrane being very low, differences between the various treatments were noted. The pH of the digestate treated by N2 recirculation was lower than the other digesters and decreased further after distillers’ spent grain was substituted for brewers’ spent grain. Aeration at a pressure of 26 mm Hg and 100 mg Hg increased biogas production compared to other treatments but only significantly so at 100 mm Hg. These results suggest that partial purging of dissolved gases in anaerobic digestate by the small fluxes of N2 or O2 across a permeable membrane may affect digester performance."

1360,"title:Inactivation of Selected Bacterial Pathogens in Dairy Cattle Manure by Mesophilic Anaerobic Digestion (Balloon Type Digester),abstract:Anaerobic digestion of animal manure in biogas digesters has shown promise as a technology in reducing the microbial load to safe and recommended levels. We sought to treat dairy manure obtained from the Fort Hare Dairy Farm by investigating the survival rates of bacterial pathogens, through a total viable plate count method, before, during and after mesophilic anaerobic digestion. Different microbiological media were inoculated with different serial dilutions of manure samples that were withdrawn from the biogas digester at 3, 7 and 14 day intervals to determine the viable cells. Data obtained indicated that the pathogens of public health importance were 90%–99% reduced in the order: Campylobacter sp. (18 days) < Escherichia coli sp. (62 days) < Salmonella sp. (133 days) from a viable count of 10.1 × 103, 3.6 × 105, 7.4 × 103 to concentrations below the detection limit (DL = 102 cfu/g manure), respectively. This disparity in survival rates may be influenced by the inherent characteristics of these bacteria, available nutrients as well as the stages of the anaerobic digestion process. In addition, the highest p-value i.e., 0.957 for 
E. coli showed the statistical significance of its model and the strongest correlation between its reductions with days of digestion. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that the specific bacterial pathogens in manure can be considerably reduced through anaerobic digestion after 133 days."

In this study, the anaerobic digestion process of dry toilet generated blackwater was investigated by means of a biomethane potential test. It was demonstrated that anaerobic digestion was inhibited and then adapted because of a high total ammonium nitrogen (TAN) level (3673.3 mg/L). The start-up period was 14.04 days and the biomethane potential of dry toilet blackwater was 402.36 mLCH4/gVS (55 days, 38 C). Inhabitation and adaptation could be described as the increase of free ammonia nitrogen content and acetic acid concentration, followed by an enhancement of the relative abundance of acetic acid-type methanogens (from 33.53–61.52%). The main pathogen in dry toilet blackwater fermentation broth, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, kept multiplying in the first 8 days and then stabilized at a higher level than that of the beginning. This work showed the self-adjustment process and pathogen dynamics of dry toilet blackwater anaerobic digestion and highlights the significance of dry toilet blackwater characteristics when designing and maintaining anaerobic digestion sanitary treatment and reuse systems."

Pyrolysis results illustrated higher impact across water, fossil fuel, and mineral depletion, although still providing a better option than conventional landfilling of food waste. The dewatering phase in the AD process accounted for 70% of the treatment impact while the pre-treatment of the food waste was responsible for the main burden in the pyrolysis process.

Ammonium thiocyanate and urea deep eutectic solvent pretreatments under different conditions in terms of the components ratio and temperature were examined on corn stover waste biomass. The lignocellulose biomass was characterized in detail for its chemistry and morphology to determine the effect of the pretreatment on the natural biocomposite. Furthermore, the implications on biomethane production through anaerobic digestion with different loadings of corn stover biomass at 35 g/L and 50 g/L were tested. The results showed an increase of 48% for a cumulative biomethane production for a DES-pretreated biomass, using a solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:2 at 100 C for 60 min, which is a strong indication that DES-pretreatment significantly enhanced biomethane production."

1509,"title:Mapping of Biomass Fluxes: A Method for Optimizing Biogas-Refinery of Livestock Effluents ,abstract:This paper presents the topic of the management of livestock effluents and, therefore, nutrients (particularly N) in the framework of the biogas supply chain. The 
bio-refinery will be analyzed as a unique system, from the farm to the biomass produced and sent to anaerobic digestion, focusing on the fate/change of the flow of material and nutrients content through the system. Within four categories of farms considered in the article, integrated ones frequently have a breeding consistency from 90 to 320 heads, according to more extensive or intensive settings. These farms must manage from 3.62 to 12.81 m3 day−1 of slurry and from 11.40 to 40.34 kg day−1 of nitrogen (N) as the sum of excreta from all herd categories. By selecting a hypo-protein diet, a reduction of 10% and 24% for total effluent amount and for N excreted, respectively, can be achieved. Nitrogen can be reduced up to 45% if the crude protein content is limited and a further 0.23% if animals of similar ages, weights and (or) production or management are grouped and fed according to specific requirements. Integrated farms can implement farming activity with biogas production, possibly adding agricultural residues to the anaerobically-digested biomass. Average biogas yields for cattle effluents range from 200 to 400 m3 ton−1 VS (volatile solids). Values from 320 to 672 m3 day−1 of biogas can be produced, obtaining average values from 26 to 54.5 kWe (kilowatt-electric). This type of farm can well 
balance farm-production profit, environmental protection, animal husbandry well-being and 
energy self-sufficiency.

1512,"title:Mathematical Modeling for Evaluating the Sustainability of Biogas Generation through Anaerobic Digestion of Livestock  Waste,abstract:The paper investigates the mathematical modeling of anaerobic fermentation for the utilization of animal wastes. It analyzes various approaches to the mathematical modeling of anaerobic digestion processes. However, most of the models previously proposed do not take into account a number of key parameters such as the levels of micro and macronutrientls (such as K, Na, Ca, Mg, Mo, etc.), values of volatile fatty acids, C/N ratio, pH levels, extent of grinding, moisture, and others. This paper proposes a new mathematical model of anaerobic fermentation under industrial scale conditions. The model was developed on the basis of regression analysis and correlation. It found empirical relationships between biogas yield and 26 different parameters. These parameters are measured by appropriate biosensors in industrial production. Some of them have more significant influence on the fermentation process than others. Overall, the developed mathematical model has the potential to provide useful insights into biogas production and can be used to optimize anaerobic fermentation processes."

1548,"title:Methodological Approaches to Optimising Anaerobic Digestion of Water Hyacinth for Energy Efficiency in South Africa,abstract:Anaerobic digestion has been identified as a feasible fragment of a bioeconomy, yet numerous factors hinder the adoption of the technology in South Africa. Apart from its energy recovery, other nonmarket advantages support the technology. Though it may be challenging to have a price tag, they provide clear added worth for such investments. With a growing energy demand and global energy transitions, there is a need to sustainably commercialise the biogas industry in South Africa. Most studies are at laboratory scale and under specific conditions, which invariably create gaps in using their data for commercialising the biogas technology. The key to recognising these gaps depends on knowing the crucial technical phases that have the utmost outcome on the economics of biogas production. This study is a meta-analysis of the optimisation of anaerobic digestion through methodological approaches aimed at enhancing the production of biogas. This review, therefore, argues that regulating the fundamental operational parameters, understanding the microbial community’s interactions, and modelling the anaerobic processes are vital indicators for improving the process stability and methane yield for the commercialisation of the technology. It further argues that South Africa can exploit water hyacinth as a substrate for a self-sufficient biogas production system in a bid to mitigate the invasive alien plants."

1552,"title:Microalgae Cultivation on Anaerobic Digestate of Municipal Wastewater, Sewage Sludge and Agro-Waste,abstract:Microalgae are fast-growing photosynthetic organisms which have the potential to be exploited as an alternative source of liquid fuels to meet growing global energy demand. The cultivation of microalgae, however, still needs to be improved in order to reduce the cost of the biomass produced. Among the major costs encountered for algal cultivation are the costs for nutrients such as CO2, nitrogen and phosphorous. In this work, therefore, different microalgal strains were cultivated using as nutrient sources three different anaerobic digestates deriving from municipal wastewater, sewage sludge or agro-waste treatment plants. In particular, anaerobic digestates deriving from agro-waste or sewage sludge treatment induced a more than 300% increase in lipid production per volume in Chlorella vulgaris cultures grown in a closed photobioreactor, and a strong increase in carotenoid accumulation in different microalgae species. Conversely, a digestate originating from a pilot scale anaerobic upflow sludge blanket (UASB) was used to increase biomass production when added to an artificial nutrient-supplemented medium. The results herein demonstrate the possibility of improving biomass accumulation or lipid production using different anaerobic digestates."

1605,"title:Multilinear Regression Model for Biogas Production Prediction from Dry Anaerobic Digestion of OFMSW,abstract:The aim of this study was to develop a multiple linear regression (MLR) model to predict the specific methane production (SMP) from dry anaerobic digestion (AD) of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). A data set from an experimental test on a pilot-scale plug-flow reactor (PFR) including 332 observations was used to build the model. Pearson's correlation matrix and principal component analysis (PCA) examined the relationships between variables. Six parameters, namely total volatile solid (TVSin), organic loading rate (OLR), hydraulic retention time (HRT), C/N ratio, lignin content and total volatile fatty acids (VFAs), had a significant correlation with SMP. Based on these outcomes, a simple and three multiple linear regression models (MLRs) were developed and validated. The simple linear regression model did not properly describe the data (R2 = 0.3). In turn, the MLR including all factors showed the optimal fitting ability (R2 = 0.91). Finally, the MLR including four uncorrelated explanatory variables of feedstock characteristics and operating parameters (e.g., TVSin, OLR, C/N ratio, and lignin content), resulted in the best compromise in terms of number of explanatory variables, model fitting and predictive ability (R2 = 0.87)."

These organic compounds can be converted to renewable products through anaerobic digestion. Nevertheless, its anaerobic digestion is limited due to its high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ion concentration. The effects of nickel (Ni2+) on the stability of anaerobic digestion of molasses were established by studying the degradation of organic matter (COD removal rate), biogas yield, methane content in the biogas, pH, and alkalinity. The results showed that there were no significant effects on the stability of pH and alkalinity. Increased COD removal rate and higher methane content was observed by 2–3% in the digesters receiving 2 and 4 mg/L of Ni2+ in the first phase of the experiment. Ni2+ supplemented to reactors at concentration 2 mg/L enhanced biogas yield. Overall, it is suggested that the addition of Ni2+ has some effects on the enhancement of biogas yield and methane contents but has no obvious effects on the long-lasting stability of the molasses digestion."

The reactor temperature is considered as one of the most vital factors for the digestion process. An experiment was conducted in the Biogas Laboratory of Green Energy Knowledge Hub at Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) to examine the influence of temperature on anaerobic digestion of cow-dung. Laboratory-scale continuous stirred tank reactors with a working volume of 15 L were operated for a 30-day retention time. The reactors were set at 20 C, 25 C, 30 C, 35 C, 40 C and 45 C, respectively to determine the effect of temperature on anaerobic digestion performance. Different parameters like total solids, volatile solids, pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen, biogas production rate and methane concentration were examined. Among all the reactors, the reactor at 40 C temperature produced maximum biogas (312.43 L/kg VS) and methane yields (209.70 L/kg VS), followed by the reactors at 35 C and 30 C, respectively. Statistical analysis of the obtained experimental results using Minitab® showed that the optimum process performance in terms of methane yield and volatile solid degradation is achieved at a reactor temperature of 35.82 C."

1673,"title:Optimizing Anaerobic Digestion at Ambient Temperatures: Energy Efficiency and Cost Reduction Potential in Panama,abstract:Anaerobic digestion (AD) is usually carried out at mesophilic temperatures (25–45 C) in most countries, whether in temperate or tropical climates, which results in the need for heat injection and consequently increases costs. In this regard, batch AD tests were conducted at 25, 28, and 35 C, with 25 C being the lowest ambient temperature in Panama, using thickened secondary sludge (TSS) and digested secondary sludge (DSS) from the Juan Diaz wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to determine the Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP). The AD study generated maximum mean BMP values of 163 mL CH4/g VS for DSS and 289.72 mL CH4/g VS for codigestion at 25 C. The BMP value of DSS at 25 C showed that it can still be used for energy generation, using the lowest ambient temperature recorded in Panama City. Likewise, trials at 25 C showed a 43.48% reduction in the electrical energy produced compared to that generated at 38 C in WWTP. This results in a reduction in energy, as the use of heat could be omitted and the energy costs required for the process are covered. In this regard, the novelty of this work lies in its investigation of anaerobic digestion at ambient temperatures, which represents a departure from conventional practices that typically require higher temperatures. By exploring the feasibility of anaerobic digestion within the temperature range of 25–35 C, this study offers a novel approach to optimizing energy efficiency and reducing costs associated with elevated temperatures."

The digesters were incubated at two distinct temperatures of 55 and 37 C, and operated with varying organic loading rates (OLRs) of 2.4, 3.2, and 4.0 g COD/L.d by altering the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of acidified POME during feeding. The results indicated that the performance of anaerobic digestion increased as the OLR increased from 2.4 to 4.0 g COD/L.d. At the OLR of 4.0 g COD/L.d, the thermophilic condition showed the highest methane yield of 0.31  0.01 L/g COD, accompanied by the highest COD removal and volatile solid reduction, which were found to be higher than the mesophilic condition.

1732,"title:Possibilities for Anaerobic Digestion of Slaughter Waste and Flotates for Biomethane Production,abstract:Anaerobic digestion for biomethane production is an important tool regarding sustainable energy production. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the substrate composition and operating parameters on biomethane production during anaerobic digestion, focusing on the use of flotates and slaughterhouse waste as substrates with a high organic content. A novelty here was the use of a mbbr with circulation pump for the anaerobic treatment of flotates, sw, and their mixture. Flotates and waste from slaughterhouses offer a substrate with a high organic content. In this work, it was shown that both substrates provide a high bmp. The highest methane yield was achieved by mixing both substrates. In continuous operation, special challenges arose, due to the high nitrogen and fat content of the substrates. These could be overcome by mixing the substrates and using a circulation pump in the reactor for improved back-mixing. As a result, the highest average methane yield of 0.65 NLCH4gTS eli-1 was achieved in mesophilic operation at an olr of 4.2 gTSL-1d-1."

1741,"title:Potential Applications of Food-Waste-Based Anaerobic Digestate for Sustainable Crop Production Practice,abstract:The global food system is and will be facing many challenges in the coming decades, which will necessitate innovative solutions to address the issues of a diminishing fertilizer supply, an increasing food demand from growing populations, and frequent extreme climates due to greenhouse gas emissions. An advancement proposed is the synthesizing of fertilizer from food waste, here referred to as food waste anaerobic digestate (FWAD). This occurs through the process of anaerobic digestion, where organic matter such as food waste is contained in an anaerobic environment and allowed to be broken down by microorganisms. One of the resulting products is anaerobic digestate, which possesses the necessary nutrients for effective fertilization for crop production. In addition to reducing greenhouse gases and waste in landfills, the replacement of synthetic fertilizers with ones made from food waste would help to alleviate the impacts of the current fertilizer shortage being experienced worldwide, which will be exacerbated by a reducing supply of materials needed for synthetic fertilizer production. In this paper, we discuss the nutrient characteristics of FWAD, and recent studies utilizing FWAD in horticulture and crop production, to advance our understanding of the effectiveness and challenges of using FWAD as a fertilizer. By employing appropriate application methods, such as nitrification, dilution, and amendment, FWAD demonstrates considerable potential as an effective fertilizer for a wide range of leafy greens and some fruiting crops."

However, plants differ in terms of the number of reactors and, in case of several reactors, their operation mode. To confirm the flexibility of well adapted, full-scale anaerobic digestion plants, we monitored the physicochemical process conditions of two continuously stirred tank reactors over one hydraulic retention time before and after the operation mode was switched from parallel to serial operation. To investigate changes in the involved microbiota, we applied Illumina amplicon sequencing. The rapid change between operation modes did not affect the process performance. In both parallel and serial operation mode, we detected a highly diverse microbial community, in which Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Claocimonetes were high in relative abundance. While a prominent core microbiome was maintained in both configurations, changes in the involved microbiota were evident at a lower taxonomical level comparing both reactors and operation modes. The most prominent methanogenic Euryarchaeota detected were Methanosaeta and cand. Methanofastidiosum. Volatile fatty acids were degraded immediately in both reactors, suggesting that the second reactor could be used to produce methane on demand, by inserting easily degradable substrates."

Struvite precipitation (SP) is an effective means to remove TAN and enhance the buffering of substrates. Different Mg and P sources were evaluated as reactants in SP in acidogenic digester effluents to reduce its TAN levels. In order to measure impact of TAN removal, a standard biochemical methane potential (BMP) test was conducted to measure methane yield from treatments that had the highest TAN reductions. SP results showed 6 of 9 reagent combinations resulted in greater than 70% TAN removal. The BMP results indicated that SP treatment by adding Mg(OH)2 and H3PO4 resulted in 57.6% nitrogen recovery and 41.7% increase in methane yield relative to the substrate without SP. SP is an effective technology to improve nutrient recovery and methane production from the anaerobic digestion of protein-rich feedstocks."

2001,"title:The Effect of Exogenous Oxytetracycline on High-Temperature Anaerobic Digestion of Elements in Swine Wastewater,abstract:Tetracycline antibiotics (TCs) are a common type of antibiotic found in swine wastewater. Oxytetracycline (OTC) is a significant type of TC. This study mainly examined the influence of OTC on high-temperature anaerobic digestion by adding OTC to collections of swine wastewater at different times during the digestion process. The results showed that high-temperature anaerobic digestion was suitable for the removal of TCs, with an 87% OTC removal efficiency achieved by day 20. Additionally, OTC added from external sources was found to inhibit the chlortetracycline degradation process and affect the first-order degradation kinetic model of TCs. Complexation reactions were the main ways in which OTC affected the heavy metal content of the water. The exogenous addition of OTC was found to inhibit the activity of some digester microbial strains, reduce the proportion of dominant strains, such as MBA03, and kill certain specific strains. This performance alteration was most obvious when OTC was added in the middle of the reaction."

2004,"title:The Effect of Substrate-Bulk Interaction on Hydrolysis Modeling in Anaerobic Digestion Process,abstract:In an Anaerobic Digestion (AD) process treating particulate substrates, the size of solids is expected to negatively affect the rate of hydrolysis step and consequently influence the performance of the whole process. To avoid any disadvantage due to size of solids, expensive pre-treatments aimed at disintegrating and solubilizing substrates are commonly conducted prior to AD. This practice is doubtlessly successful, but not always necessary, since some organic substrates, although particulate, once immersed in water, tend to solubilize immediately. This aspect, if properly considered, could result in saving money and time in the AD process, as well as refining the development and calibration of AD mathematical models. The present study is actually aimed at demonstrating, through experiments and mathematical simulations, different results deriving from the AD process performed, under the same operating conditions, on two different substrates, i.e. homemade pasta and carrot batons, having the same particle size, but different chemical composition and texture. Experimental outcomes highlighted the effect of particles size on bio-methane production only from the bio-methanation potential tests (BMP) conducted on carrot batons. Similar results were obtained by mathematical model calibration, i.e., different kinetic constants for differently-sized carrot batons and same kinetic constant for differently-sized homemade pasta solids."

2026,"title:The Impact of Renewable Energy Policies on the Adoption of Anaerobic Digesters with Farm-Fed Wastes in Great Britain,abstract:This paper explores the effects of the feed-in tariff (FiT) and renewable heat incentive (RHI) schemes on the adoption of anaerobic digesters (AD), and the potential energy generation from farm-fed wastes in Great Britain. This paper adopts a linear programming model, developed in the International Energy Agency (IEA) TIMES platform, aiming to quantify the degree of adoption of AD and the type of energy generation technologies that can be driven by digester biogas to reduce farm energy costs. The results show that the adoption of AD is cost-beneficial for all farms, but different rates of the FiT and RHI schemes will influence the competitiveness between the implementation of combined heat and power (CHP) systems and the utilisation of biogas to only generate heat. The choice of technology is further dependent on the electricity/heat use ratio of the farms and the energy content of the feedstock. The results show that pig farms will more readily adopt CHP, because of its relatively higher electricity-to-heat use ratio, compared to other types of farms, which will favour biogas boilers."

2029,"title:The Improvement of Rice Straw Anaerobic Co-Digestion with Swine Wastewater by Solar/Fe(II)/PS Pretreatment,abstract:Rice straw (RS) is among the agricultural waste products with the highest methane production potential in the world, but the refractory complex structure and high carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of RS cause low methane conversion efficiency and limit its widespread application in anaerobic digestion. In this study, Solar/Fe (II)/persulfate (PS) pretreatment of RS was investigated to improve microbial accessibility, and anaerobic co-digestion combined pretreated RS and swine wastewater (SW) were evaluated to improve the efficiency of anaerobic digestion. The results showed that the Solar/Fe (II)/PS pretreatment could disrupt the structure of RS and promote the reduction of sugar content, increasing microbial accessibility to RS. When all the components of the pretreated RS (including the use of the solution remaining from the pretreatment) were anaerobically co-digested with SW, the cumulative biogas production and cumulative methane production reached 252.10 mL/gVS and 163.71 mL/gVS, 19.18% and 36.97% higher than the anaerobic co-digestion of untreated RS and SW, respectively. The anaerobic co-digestion of the Solar/Fe (II)/PS-pretreated RS with SW is a promising approach to achieving the utilization of RS components and maximizing methane yields, providing a cost-effective and pollution-free method for the production of high-quality bioenergy from agricultural waste."

How to stabilize the digestate’s characteristics so that they do not disturb the bio-system is a critical issue for digestate management. Chemically enhanced primary treatment (CEPT) was investigated as a pretreatment option for digestate treatment. The performance of CEPT for digestate management was carried out under rapid mixing (200 r/min) and slow stirring (40 r/min), respectively. The optimal dosage of ferric chloride (FeCl3) was 40 mg/L. The combination of FeCl3 and anionic polyacrylamide (APAM) had no obvious influence on TP removal, while COD removal efficiency was improved by 15.4%. The digestate pH and temperature remained stable for CEPT application and required no adjustment. The results indicate that CEPT was effective and feasible in enhancing the removal of COD and TP for digestate pretreatment by using FeCl3 and APAM."
