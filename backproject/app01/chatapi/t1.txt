There is a wide variety of materials added to anaerobic digestion studies that are designed to improve the waste degradation process, increase gas production, reduce waste treatment time, or improve environmental friendliness. Below are some examples of common added materials:
Organic waste: This is one of the most common materials added, including food residues, agricultural waste, household waste, etc., and is used as the main carbon and energy source.
Nitrogen source materials: Nitrogen sources such as urea, ammonia, plant and animal residues are added to maintain a proper carbon to nitrogen ratio and promote microbial growth.
Microbial culture materials: including vitamins, minerals and microbial strains, used to increase microbial activity and population.
Buffers and pH regulators: e.g. lime, bicarbonate, used to maintain a suitable pH range and prevent fluctuations in acidity.
Inhibitors: used to inhibit the growth of specific microbial communities to minimize unwanted reactions, e.g., inhibitors of sulfate-reducing bacteria.
Adsorbents: e.g. activated carbon, used to remove organic contaminants from waste and improve digestion efficiency.
Moisture regulators: additive materials, such as moisture adsorbents or porous materials, used to regulate the moisture content within the reactor.
Auxiliary carbon sources: e.g. acetic acid, whey, starch, etc., used to change the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the waste and improve methane production.
Biological improvers: including specific strains of bacteria, biological stimulants, etc., used to improve microbial activity and waste decomposition.
Fermentation agents: organic acids, pectinases, etc. to accelerate fermentation and degradation of waste.
Surfactants: used to improve solubility and microbial adhesion of waste.
Natural fillers: e.g. wood chips, straw, rice straw, etc., which can be used as structural support and degradation aids.
Substrate additives: Specific substrates, such as lactic acid, whey slurry, and fatty acids, can be used to direct gas production pathways and improve gas production efficiency.
The selection and quantitative addition of these materials depends on factors such as the nature of the waste, treatment goals, reactor type, and operating conditions. Researchers adapt and optimize the type and amount of added materials to specific project needs to achieve optimal anaerobic digestion.

The addition of various materials during anaerobic digestion can significantly affect the waste treatment efficiency and the gas products produced. The following is a detailed analysis of the effect of quantitative addition of different materials on anaerobic digestion and their quantitative effects:
1. Carbon source materials:
Quantitative impact: Increasing the addition of a carbon source usually increases gas production, especially methane gas.
Detailed analysis: Increasing the carbon source can provide more digestible organic material and promote the growth and activity of microorganisms, thus increasing the production of methane. However, adding too much carbon source may lead to over-acidic reaction and reduce the stability of the system.
2. Nitrogen source material:
Impact: Moderate amounts of nitrogen sources help maintain the carbon to nitrogen ratio and increase the rate of waste degradation.
Quantitative impact: moderate addition of nitrogen source can increase methane production, but excessive addition may lead to ammonia and nitrogen accumulation.
Detailed Analysis: Nitrogen is an essential component of microbial growth, and moderate additions of nitrogen can improve anaerobic digestion by promoting microbial growth and activity. Insufficient nitrogen source may limit the growth of microorganisms, while excessive nitrogen source may lead to excessive ammonia nitrogen or sulfate in the gas product, which may cause negative impact on the environment.
3. microbial species:
QUANTITATIVE IMPACT: The introduction of specific gas-producing microbial species can increase the production of specific gas products, such as methane.
Detailed analysis: the addition of specific microbial species, such as methanogenic bacteria, can be directed to promote the production of specific gases. This is useful for specific targets in waste treatment and resource recovery. Note, however, that different microbial species may have different adaptations to environmental conditions and waste properties.
4. Buffers and pH regulators:
Impact: maintaining an appropriate pH range is critical for microbial activity. Lime: is used to maintain a neutral or alkaline environment in the reactor and helps stabilize the digestion process. Bicarbonate: can be used to adjust the pH of the reactor to prevent overly acidic or alkaline conditions from occurring.
Quantitative effects: Addition in the right amount helps stabilize the pH, but over-addition may lead to alkaline conditions.
Detailed Analysis: Maintaining an appropriate pH range is critical for microbial growth and waste decomposition. Lack of buffers may result in a drop in pH, creating acidic conditions that inhibit microbial activity. Excessive buffers, on the other hand, may lead to alkaline conditions.
5. Microbial culture substances:
Impact: Vitamins, minerals and microbial strains can increase microbial activity and numbers.
Quantitative impact: moderate addition can increase microbial activity, but excessive amounts may lead to microbial community imbalance.
Detailed analysis: microbial culture substances to supplement the nutrition required by microorganisms, but should be added carefully to avoid unnecessary costs and excessive microbial communities.
6. reactor design:
Quantitative impact: the choice of reactor type and size has a significant impact on the efficiency and gas production of anaerobic digestion.
DETAILED ANALYSIS: The type of reactor (e.g., complete mixed reactor or fixed bed reactor) can influence the microbial distribution and gas yield in the reactor. Quantitative selection of reactor size should take into account waste volume and treatment rate.
7. Additives and auxiliary materials:
Quantitative impact: the addition of microbial nutrients and adsorbents can affect the growth of microorganisms and the removal efficiency of pollutants in the waste.
Detailed analysis: The addition of microbial nutrients in the right amount can improve the activity of microorganisms, thus accelerating the decomposition of waste. The addition of adsorbents can improve the pollutant removal efficiency, but excessive use may reduce gas production.
8, organic waste:
Impact: organic waste is a major carbon and energy source and is critical to the anaerobic digestion process.
Quantitative impact: increasing the addition of organic waste usually increases methane gas production, but overdosing may lead to reactor oversaturation.
Detailed analysis: Organic wastes provide the carbon source needed by microorganisms to promote microbial growth and waste decomposition. The amount added should be adjusted according to the nature of the waste and the capacity of the reactor to avoid over- or under-addition.
9. Inhibitors:
Impact: Inhibitors reduce unwanted microbial activity.
Quantitative impact: Moderate use can control specific microbial communities, but excessive amounts may reduce overall waste treatment efficiency.
DETAILED ANALYSIS: Inhibitors can be used to control unwanted microorganisms, but should be used carefully to avoid adverse effects on beneficial microorganisms.
10. Adsorbents:
IMPACT: Adsorbents may improve the removal efficiency of organic contaminants.
QUANTITATIVE IMPACT: Moderate use may improve removal efficiency, but excessive use may reduce gas production.
Detailed analysis: adsorbents can be used to improve the removal efficiency of pollutants, but the amount added should be balanced between maximizing the removal effect and gas production.
11, moisture regulator:
Impact: regulating moisture content can affect the performance and stability of the reactor.
Quantitative impact: moderate use can maintain suitable moisture conditions, but overuse may lead to dilution effect of the reactor.
DETAILED ANALYSIS: Moisture regulators can be used to control moisture in the reactor, but should be dosed according to the characteristics of the waste.
In summary, dosing different materials needs to be carefully balanced to achieve optimum anaerobic digestion. This takes into account the nature of the waste, the treatment objectives and the environmental conditions to ensure that the process is stable, efficient and environmentally friendly. Quantitative analysis can help optimize anaerobic digestion systems to meet specific waste treatment needs.
