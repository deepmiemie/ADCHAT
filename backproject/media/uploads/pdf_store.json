Agriculture is responsible for 27% of Ireland\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and is the largest contributing sector. \nPenetration of renewable energy in the heat and transport sectors is falling short of targets, and there is no clear \nplan for achieving them. The anaerobic digestion of grass to produce biogas or biomethane is put forward as a mul-\ntifaceted solution, which could help meet energy and emissions targets, reduce dependence on imported energy, \nand provide additional farm income. This paper addresses the economic viability of such a system. Grass biogas\/\nbiomethane fares poorly under the current combined heat and power tariff structure, which is geared toward feed-\nstock that attracts a gate fee. Tariff structures similar to those used in other countries are necessary for the industry \nto develop. Equally, regulation should be implemented to allow injection of biomethane into the gas grid in Ireland. \nBlends of natural gas and biomethane can be sold, offering a cost-competitive green fuel. Sale as a renewable trans-\nport fuel could allow pro\ufb01 tability for the farmer and savings for the consumer, but suffers due to the lack of a market. \nUnder current conditions, the most economically viable outlet for grass biomethane is sale as a renewable heating \nfuel. The key to competitiveness is the existing natural gas infrastructure that enables distribution of grass biometh-\nane, and the renewable energy targets that allow renewable fuels to compete against each other. \u00a9 2010 Society of \nChemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd\nKeywords: grass; biogas; biomethane; biofuels; economic analysis\nIntroduction\nFarming in crisis\nFarm incomes in Ireland are in decline. When infl ation is \ntaken into account, the average family farm income (FFI) \nfor all farming systems decreased by 22% in real terms from \n1995 to 2008.1 Th ere is a growing dependence on grants and \nsubsidies in all farming sectors and without them beef and \nsheep farms would operate at a loss. Low FFIs mean that \nmany farmers are seeking opportunities for farm diversifi -\ncation and alternative sources of income, and the National \nDevelopment Plan2 recognizes as a key task the promotion of \nModeling and Analysis\n520\n\u00a9 2010 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd  |  Biofuels, Bioprod.

A move away from \nconventional farming can be further supported by the fact \nthat all grass-based  farming systems (beef, dairy, and sheep) \nproduce large quantities for the export market. Th is is espe-\ncially true in the beef sector, which had self-suffi  ciency val-\nues of over 600% for each year in the period 2000 to 2008.3,4\nGreenhouse gas emissions in agriculture\nAgriculture was responsible for 27.3% (18.4 Mt CO2eq) of \nIreland\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2008 and was \nthe single largest contributing sector, followed by energy \nindustries (21.8%), transport (21.1%), industry and commer-\ncial (16.9%), residential (11.2%), and waste (1.6%).5 Enteric \nfermentation in non-dairy (i.e. beef) cattle is the largest \ncontributor to agricultural emissions and is one of the big-\ngest GHG emission sources in the country.6 Ireland has the \nhighest ratio of cattle to human population in the European \nUnion (from Eurostat data7,8) and the importance of the \nagricultural sector is largely responsible for the country\u2019s \nrelatively high per capita GHG emissions; in 2007 per capita \nemissions were 15.9 t CO2eq compared with 10.2 t CO2eq for \nthe EU27.9 Th e National Climate Change Strategy has put \nforward a decrease in herd size as a potential measure for \nreducing GHG emissions in the agricultural sector.10\nEnergy in crisis\nIreland is over 89% dependent on imported energy, with \nimported oil and gas accounting for 81% of energy supply.11 \nTh is has signifi cant implications for security of supply, emis-\nsions agreements under the Kyoto Protocol, and national \nand EU targets for renewable energy. Targets have been set in \nIreland for renewable energy penetration by 2020 in each of the \nthree energy sectors: 40% renewable electricity,12 12% renew-\nable heat, and 10% renewable transport fuels.13 Renewable \nenergy in the electricity sector is expected to be provided largely \nby wind, but signifi cant challenges are predicted in the heat \nand transport sectors. Ireland is currently over 99% dependent \non oil and oil products for transport energy, all of which are \nimported,14 while 96% of thermal energy is from non-renewable \nsources.11 Renewable energy sources need to be found.\nGrass for biogas, biomethane, bioNG, and bioCNG\nGrass biogas\/biomethane has been put forward as a renew-\nable energy solution.15 Anaerobic digestion (AD) is used to \nproduce biogas from grass. Biogas can be burned directly \nfor heat or electricity generation or can be upgraded to the \nsame standard as natural gas, i.e. biomethane (~97% CH4, \n~3% CO2 and some minor constituents). Biomethane and \nnatural gas are mixable and interchangeable; mixtures of \nbiomethane and natural gas are termed bioNG. BioNG can \nbe sold from the gas grid in a similar manner to renew-\nable electricity as long as an accounting system is in place \nto ensure that the quantity of biomethane injected into the \ngrid matches the quantity sold. Diff erent mixtures of bioNG \ncould be sold for diff erent purposes. To help meet the target \nfor 12% renewable heat, a blend of 12% biomethane and 88% \nnatural gas could be sold (12\/88). A 10\/90 blend could be \nsold as a transport fuel (bioCNG, or biocompressed natural \ngas) to aid in meeting the target for 10% renewable energy in \ntransport. \nAt present, there are four farm digesters in Ireland: three \ngenerate thermal energy on site and one sells electricity to \nthe grid. Th ese digesters are predominately slurry digesters \nand do not employ energy crops. Th e potential for energy \nfrom grass in Ireland is huge, however, as grass covers \naround 90%16 of the country\u2019s agricultural land. Th e exper-\ntise, knowledge, and equipment for growing, harvesting, and \nstoring grass and grass silage already exist on Irish farms. \nTh e energy balance of grass biomethane is better than other \ntemperate energy crop biofuels and compares favorably with \ntropical biofuels.17 Th e GHG savings of grass biomethane \nused as a transport fuel meet the requirements of the EU \nDirective.18 In terms of the constraints imposed by agricul-\ntural and biofuels policy, grass biomethane is the best energy \ncrop for meeting the 2020 renewable transport energy target \nin Ireland.19 An indigenous grass biogas industry could also \nprovide employment and aid in developing the \u2018greentech\u2019 \nsector.\nFocus of paper\nGrass biogas\/biomethane is a viable solution for meeting \nrenewable energy targets in Ireland in terms of available \ntechnology, energy balance, GHG savings, and policy con-\nstraints. An issue that has not yet been addressed, however, \nis fi nancial return. Th e aim of this paper is to investigate \nthe economic viability of a grass biogas\/biomethane indus-\ntry in Ireland.

Work by \nMurphy and Power15 found the cost of grass biomethane \nused as a biofuel to be competitive with wheat bioethanol. A \nUK study found that a grass biogas CHP plant would strug-\ngle to break even, even when income is maximized through \nthe sale of electricity, heat, and compost,27 while German \nstudies have found that grass biogas can be profi table under \ncertain conditions; for example, for larger plants, for plants \nin receipt of agricultural subsidies, and for plants with \nlower feedstock costs and a year-round heat market.28-31 \nTh ere has been little research into the potential markets for \nbiogas\/biomethane and nothing of this kind has been done \nfor Ireland. Th e results of this analysis are particular to \ngrass biomethane in Ireland, but the approach adopted can \nbe used for other countries and for other renewable energy \nresources.\nMethodology and description of grass \nbiomethane system\nBoundary conditions \nTh is paper is intended to act as a sister paper to previous \nwork on grass AD, including an energy balance17 and a \nGHG analysis,18 and as such uses the same farm and AD \nplant size and output (Table 1). Th e plant is based on an \noperational facility, visited by the authors in Austria, which \nprocessed 1650 tDS y-1 of grass silage. In an Irish context, \nthis is equivalent to 137.5 ha. Specialist beef production is \nthe dominant type of farming in Ireland, with an average \nfarm size of 27.5 ha.32 A farmers co-op is therefore envis-\naged, whereby a number of farmers produce the grass silage, \nown and manage the AD facility, and sell the energy product \n(electricity\/heat\/biomethane). \nMethodology\nA simple economic analysis is carried out on the system by \ncalculating annual costs and incomes, and then determining \nthe tariff  required to break even (i.e. to yield a return of 5% \nover 15 years). Th e values used for costs and incomes are rel-\nevant to the Irish context and are taken from the literature \nand from discussions with industry in Ireland and abroad. \nAnnualized capital costs are calculated from the equation in \nTable 1.

It is not expected that grass biogas will off er a \nsolution to the economic crises in farming.

Two main scenarios are considered in this \npaper:\n\u2022 Scenario 1: biogas for on-site CHP\n\u2022 Scenario 2: upgrading to biomethane standard and injec-\ntion into the gas grid\nOn-site heat production is not considered as there are lim-\nited markets for heat in Ireland. Sale as a vehicle fuel on site \nis excluded as there is unlikely to be a market in the vicin-\nity of a rural farm plant, while container transport is not \nconsidered due to logistical diffi  culties. It is assumed that \nbiomethane injected into the gas grid is purchased by a ship-\nper for sale elsewhere on the grid. Th e calculation of ship-\nping charges is beyond the scope of this study, which looks \ninstead at potential markets for biomethane from the grid \nand the price these markets would be willing to pay.\nCapital costs\nSilage storage and AD plant\nSilage is to be stored in a horizontal silo (silage pit); 21 silage \npits are required (Table 2). If we consider 5 farms of average \nsize (27.5 ha) then 4 pits are required per farm. In practice \nthe farms would already have pits, thus the estimated con-\nstruction cost of \u20ac456 250 (Table 2) must be viewed as con-\nservative. Th e cost of an AD plant depends on a number of \nfactors, including plant size and type, with larger plants gen-\nerally having lower capital costs per m3 of biogas produced. \nTh e capital cost of a plant visited by the authors in Austria, \nwhich was a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) of the \nsame size as the one in this analysis, was \u20ac745 000. As AD is \na relatively new technology to Ireland, 10% is added to this \nvalue to give \u20ac819 500 (approximately \u20ac110 t-1 feedstock). \nTh is is assumed to include the cost of in situ hydrogen sul-\nphide (H2S) removal.\nCHP plant and connection to electricity grid\nFrom discussions with industry and values in the litera-\nture,20,22,33 the cost of the CHP plant is conservatively taken \nas \u20ac1500 kWe\n-1, which is the fully installed cost including \nOn-site heat\nOn-site CHP\nGrid\nOff-site\ncompression\nOff-site\nfilling station\nOff-site gas\nOff-site CHP\nContainer\ntransport\nOn-site filling\nstation\nFeedstock\ne.g. grass silage\nBiogas\nOn-site\ncompression\nBioCNG\nBiomethane\nNatural\ngas\nOff-site\nCCGT\nFigure 1.

Assuming \n85% operational effi  ciency, the cost of a 220 kWe CHP plant \nis \u20ac330 000. Th e cost of connection to the electricity grid \nis very site-specifi c and depends on the location of the new \ngenerator in relation to the existing loads and generation on \nthe network, as well as the distance from the grid. A survey \nof a number of developers puts the typical cost for a 200\u2013250 \nkWe facility as \u20ac80 000 for connection equipment, \u20ac10 000 \nfor a connection study, and \u20ac10 000 for the substation (if \nrequired). Underground lines cost around \u20ac50 000 km-1; \n400-meter lines costing \u20ac20 000 are assumed in this analy-\nsis, giving a total cost of \u20ac120 000.\nUpgrading plant and connection to gas grid\nTh e capital cost of an upgrading facility is highly dependent \non plant size, with smaller plants having higher costs per m3 \nof upgraded gas. A membrane plant with a capital cost of \n\u20ac500 000 (\u20ac0.10 kWh-1 y-1) is assumed, which includes gas \nmetering and quality monitoring, and is similar to values in \nthe literature.15,34 Th e cost of connection to the gas grid can \nvary widely and depends on distance to the network, ground \nconditions, and the type of pipes, grid connection, and com-\npressor. Contractual costs can form a signifi cant part of the \noverall cost. Th ere are currently no biomethane plants with \ngrid injection in Ireland and a full pricing scheme has yet \nto be developed. It is assumed that the upgrading plant is \nlocated within 0.5 km of the distribution network, which has \na pressure of about 4.2 bar. Th e cost of installing distribution \npipes is very site specifi c; values between \u20ac150 000 km-1 and \n\u20ac400 000 km-1 have been estimated in the literature35 and in \ndiscussions with Bord G\u00e1is (the Irish Gas Board). Bearing \nin mind the variability associated with this item, the total \ncapital cost of connection to the gas grid is estimated at \u20ac200 \n000. Upgrading plants typically pressurize gas up to 7 bar, \nso no additional compressor is required.\nOperating costs\nSilage harvesting\nYield per hectare has the biggest infl uence on the cost of \nsilage. Other factors include the cost of machinery and \nlabor. Th e volatility in oil prices, which directly aff ects fuel \nand fertilizer costs, results in considerable fl uctuations in \nthe cost of producing silage. Two-cut silage with an annual \nyield of 12 tDS ha-1 is used in this analysis. Th e cost of get-\nting a hectare of grass into the pit is \u20ac950 ha-1 (\u20ac17 t-1), which \nincludes fertilizer, reseeding, lime, plastic, and contractor \ncharges (calculated from data in Teagasc36). According to \nKorres et al.,18 an application of 300 kg N ha-1 y-1 is required \nin establishment years and 225 kg N ha-1 y-1 in subsequent \nyears. As the market price of silage is around 40% higher, it \nis important that grass silage is produced on-farm and not \npurchased at market prices. In order to maintain high biogas \nyields, silage losses in the fi eld and in the silage pit should be \nkept to a minimum and effl  uent from the pit should be col-\nlected and added to the digester.\nAD plant\nTh e operational cost of an AD plant is made up of the cost \nof labor, electricity (for mixing and pumping), heating \nfuel (either biogas or imported fuel to meet the parasitic \nheat demand), and maintenance, and depends on the type \nof process used. Previous work suggests annual opera-\ntional costs of an AD plant (excluding feedstock) to be of \nthe order of 10\u201312% of the unsubsidized capital costs.37,38 \nWork in the UK27 and Sweden39 used values of 4% and \n15%, respectively. A value of 10% is used in this analysis. \nAn additional allowance of 6.67% of the unsubsidized \ncapital costs is made for depreciation of the AD, CHP, and \nupgrading plants. Th is allows for a fund equal to the initial \ninvestment to be available aft er the 15-year lifetime of the \nfacility. Th e inclusion of a depreciation fund results in a \nrelatively conservative  analysis, as not all developers allow \nfor such a fund.\nTable 2.

Th is is at the lower end of the range quoted by the \nSwedish Gas Centre40 for plants of this size. Th e plant in \nthis analysis upgrades around 110 m3 h-1 of raw gas (assum-\ning an operational effi  ciency of 85%) and is relatively small \ncompared with operational plants in Germany and Sweden. \nMembrane plants have lower maintenance and energy \nrequirements leading to lower operating costs than for other \ntechnologies.41\nConnection to electricity grid and gas grid\nIt is assumed that the renewable energy tariff  received for \nelectricity is the net revenue to the renewable energy pro-\nvider; additional costs have not been included in the analysis \nfor this item. Th e operating costs of the compression plant \nfor injection into the gas grid are assumed to be included \nin the upgrading costs. Th e operating costs for metering \nand quality monitoring are also included in the cost of the \nupgrading plant.\nFinance and subsidies\nCapital\nTh ere is a national scheme in place off ering capital grants for \nbiogas CHP plants of up to 30% of the eligible capital costs.42 \nTh e maximum grant is assumed in this analysis. Th ere are \nno specifi c grants for biomethane plants injecting into the \ngas grid, although there are a number of national and EU \nschemes that could potentially provide funding. Th ree sub-\nscenarios are investigated: 30% grant toward capital costs, \n50% grant, and no grant.\nOperational\nTh e Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is a system of sub-\nsidies and support programs for agriculture operated by \nthe EU. In addition to standard farm payments, there are a \nnumber of schemes under CAP which could provide addi-\ntional support for a grass biogas\/biomethane system, such \nas the Energy Crops Scheme and the Rural Environmental \nProtection Scheme (REPS). Th is paper carries out the \n economic analysis with and without agricultural subsidies. \nTh e average direct payment received by cattle rearing farms is \n\u20ac461 ha-1 (from 2006, 2007, and 2008 farm survey data1,43).\nIncome\nBiogas\nBiogas can be used on site to generate end products which \ncan then be sold, i.e. heat, electricity, and biomethane. \nTh e price paid for heat depends on what it is replacing or \nwhat the alternative is.  Examples of average commercial \nfuel costs44 are: oil at \u20ac0.058\u20130.069 kWhth\n-1 (depending \non grade); wood pellets at \u20ac0.036 kWhth\n-1 (bulk) or \u20ac0.061 \nkWhth\n-1 (bagged); wood chips at \u20ac0.034 kWhth\n-1; and natural \ngas at \u20ac0.04 kWhth\n-1 (based on a medium-sized business and \nincluding standing charges). It is assumed that \u20ac0.06 kWhth\n-1 \nis paid for heat in this analysis. Subtracting value added tax \n(VAT) of 13.5%, the income to the biogas plant is \u20ac0.053 \nkWhth\n-1.

Th ere is considerable volatility \nin the wholesale price of natural gas, which varies depend-\ning on the season and on international markets. A fi gure of \n\u20ac0.02\u20130.03 kWh-1 is assumed and this is considered the min-\nimum tariff  for biomethane injected into the grid and is used \nfor comparison in the initial analysis. A biomethane tariff  \nsystem should incentivize renewable gas and off er a higher \nreturn than for fossil gas. Biomethane injected into the grid \ncan be used in the heat, electricity, or transport sectors, and \nthe existing market conditions will infl uence the price paid. \nPotential markets and market prices are discussed in the \nsection on improving the viability.\nDigestate\nFor farm-based AD plants, it is common practice for the \ndigestate to be returned to the land serving the plant, thus \nreplacing chemical fertilizer and off ering fi nancial savings. \nTh e amount of fertilizer replaced depends on the nutrient \ncontent of the digestate, but there is limited information on \ngrass digestate17 and it is diffi  cult to estimate its value.

Th is results in a \nbreak-even electricity price of \u20ac0.166 kWhe\n-1 (G+E+H), which, \nalthough 15% lower than the base-case value of \u20ac0.196 kWhe\n-1, \nis still higher than the current tariff  of \u20ac0.12 kWhe\n-1. Th e size-\ncost relationship developed by Walla and Schneeberger46 sug-\ngests the per kWh cost of the 440 kWe facility is only 5% lower \nthan that of the 220 kWe facility, indicating little benefi t from \nincreasing plant size. Th eir analysis also showed that the high-\nest cost savings are achievable when moving from small plants \nto plants of around 200 kWe in size; above this, costs continue \nto decline at a much lower rate and few further cost benefi ts \nare achieved in plants over 1000 kWe.46\nIncreasing the quantity of grass silage would also result in \nincreased transport distances for silage delivery and digestate \ndisposal, as well as in more traffi  c movements. Ideally, trans-\nport distances and the number of journeys should be kept \nto a minimum because of associated costs, emissions, and \nnuisance on rural roads, and the related planning permission \nrequirements. Average haul distance is dependent on silage \nyields and silage availability (Box 3). Th e high silage yields \nin Ireland and the high percentage of land under grass (50% \ntotal land area) mean that haul distance is very much depend-\nent on the percentage of land contracted to the plant in a \ngiven area. For a plant using silage from 137.5 ha, the aver-\nage haul distance, assuming 10% of grassland is contracted, \nis 2.8 km; for a 275 ha plant, the distance is 3.9 km. Th ese \ndistances are within the range used in the literature (e.g. 10 \nkm for grass;48 6 km for slurry in a large centralized plant;33 \nand 5\u20138 km for operational plants in Denmark49). If only 1% \nof grassland is contracted to the plant, the average haul dis-\ntance rises to 12.5 km for the 275 ha plant; for a 1 MWe plant, \nrequiring around 625 ha of grass silage, the average haul dis-\ntance is 18.8 km. Th erefore, as plant size increases, particular \nattention needs to be paid to silage availability.\nSuggested measures for pro\ufb01 tability\nUnder current conditions, profi tability of grass biogas CHP \nis possible, but diffi  cult, and relies on:\n\u2022 keeping operational costs to a minimum;\n\u2022 fi nding a year round market for heat, although this may \nprove challenging due to limited heat markets in Ireland; \nand\n\u2022 maintaining current farming subsidies.\nScenario 2: Biogas to biomethane to grid\nBase-case economic analysis\nTh e plant produces biomethane on site and the biomethane \nis injected into the gas grid. Th e boundary of the analy-\nsis is at injection into the grid and the break-even price of \nbiomethane sold to the grid is calculated. Th ree diff erent \nscenarios are considered: \n1. Receipt of grant for 50% of capital cost (50G)\n2. Receipt of grant for 30% of capital cost (30G)\n3. No grant (NG)\nTh e break-even price of gas is found to be \u20ac0.10, \u20ac0.108 \nand \u20ac0.121 kWh-1, assuming 50%, 30%, and 0% capital grant \nrespectively (Table 4). If the farming subsidy of \u20ac461 ha-1 is \nincluded, the break-even price falls to between \u20ac0.086 and \n\u20ac0.107 kWh-1. Th is is uncompetitive with the wholesale price \nof natural gas, which is around \u20ac0.02\u2013\u20ac0.03 kWh-1.\nImproving the economics\nReducing the operating costs and depreciation (as for \nthe CHP plant) brings the break-even gas price down to \n\u20ac0.081\u2013\u20ac0.102 kWh-1 excluding the farming subsidy, and \n\u20ac0.067\u2013\u20ac0.088 if the subsidy is included (Table 4). Even in \nthe best-case scenario, the break-even price is still more than \ndouble the wholesale price of natural gas.\nCo-digestion\nPros and cons of co-digestion\nIt is common practice to digest the main substrate with a \nco-substrate, as this frequently improves the  performance of \nBox 3.

Larger plants can also take advantage \nof economies of scale, and tend to have lower capital and \noperational costs per tonne of feedstock. On the downside, \ncurrent legislation restricts the use of substrates from cer-\ntain sources and may lead to higher AD processing and \ndigestate disposal costs. Th ere is also ongoing uncertainty in \nthe waste sector in Ireland, over issues such as waste collec-\ntion rights, planning permission, and preferred technologies.\nAnimal byproducts\nMany materials suitable for AD, either on their own or as \na co-substrate, are animal byproducts (ABPs). ABPs can \npose a threat to animal and human health via the environ-\nment if not properly disposed of, potentially causing disease \nand contamination of the food and feed chain. Because \nagriculture is such an important part of the Irish economy, \naccounting for 8.1%, 8.1% and 9.8% of GDP, employment, \nand exports respectively,50 problems associated with the \nincorrect handling of ABPs can have wide-reaching impacts. \nTh e collection, transport, storage, handling, processing, and \nuse or disposal of all ABPs are therefore tightly controlled by \nthe ABP regulations.\nTh e regulations51 divide ABPs into three categories based \non their potential risk to animals, the public or to the envi-\nronment, and set out how each category must or may be \ndisposed of. Category 1 is high-risk material and may not \nbe used in an anaerobic digester. Provided requirements for \nprocess parameters (e.g. temperature treatment) and the \nplant location (e.g. in relation to animal access) are met, \nCategories 2 and 3 may be used as feedstock for AD, as \nfollows:\n\u2022  Category 2 material comprising milk, manure, digestive \ntract content.\n\u2022  Category 3 material comprising former foodstuff s, cater-\ning waste (including cooking oil), feathers, milk, certain \nfi sh and fi sh products, shells, hatchery byproducts, egg \nbyproducts, processed animal protein.\nTh e ABP regulations lay down requirements for process-\ning (i.e. hygenization) of ABPs and for disposal of digestate \n(e.g. grazing restrictions and the type of crops that can be \ngrown on land fertilized with digestate). Th e level of treat-\nment required and the restrictions regarding digestate dis-\nposal depend on plant size, the type and quantity of ABPs, \nthe source of ABPs (on-farm or imported), and the end use \nof the digestate. Compliance with the regulations can add \nsignifi cant cost and must be weighed against the gate fees \nreceived for the ABPs. While the regulations are obviously \nneeded to protect human and animal health and the envi-\nronment, the strict requirements pose challenges for the \ndevelopment of AD in Ireland and have been a stumbling \nblock for the industry. Th e Department of Agriculture, \nFisheries and Food has recognized this and is currently in \nconsultation with industry with the aim of facilitating the \ngrowth of AD.52\nCattle slurry\nTh is paper considers a cooperative AD plant among a \ngroup of livestock farmers; the most obvious co-substrate \nis therefore cattle slurry. From a microbiological perspec-\ntive, cattle slurry is a recommended co-substrate for grass \nsilage.53 Other benefi ts of digesting cattle slurry include \nimproved nutrient management, reduced odors, and less risk \nof pollution. However, these benefi ts are not translated into \nfi nancial incentives in Ireland. Previous studies26,45 have \nfound that, if the non-market co-benefi ts are excluded, the \nAD of farm wastes is generally not fi nancially viable. Th is is \nexacerbated by the dilute nature of cattle slurry and its low \nmethane yield (10% DS, 140 m3 CH4 tVSadded\n-1 54), meaning \nthat larger digestion tanks and operational energy demands \n(heating and mixing) are required than for grass silage (22% \nDS, 300 m3 tVSadded\n-1), but with much lower energy return. \nWith reference to Box 4, a simplifi ed economic analysis of a \nslurry biomethane system is presented. It may be noted that \n29 700 t y-1 of slurry is needed to produce the same biometh-\nane as 137.5 ha of grassland. Th is requires the slurry of 5690 \ncattle or 24 400 pigs. Th e capital cost is larger due to the \nlarger volumes associated with the dilute slurry. Allowing \nfor reduced operating costs (6.67% y-1), the cost of slurry \nbiomethane with no grants added is \u20ac1.47 m-3. Th is may be \ncompared with \u20ac1.02 m-3 for grass biomethane under similar \nconditions (Table 4).

For the CSTR consid-\nered in this analysis, a low solids content substrate such \nas slaughter waste (belly grass) would be appropriate. \nDiscussions with the slaughter waste industry in Ireland \nsuggest that gate fees of around \u20ac20 t-1 could be attracted. \nEqual quantities (7500 t y-1 of each) of grass silage and belly \ngrass are used and it is conservatively assumed that there \nare no fi nancial savings from the digestate. Th e same per \nunit capital and operating costs are assumed as for the grass \ndigester. Substantial profi ts are achievable with the CHP \nplant (Table 4), showing that the current tariff  system works \nwell for feedstock that attracts a gate fee. For grid injection, \nhowever, even the best-case scenario has a higher break-even \nprice than the wholesale price of natural gas.\nFarmers\u2019 co-op versus private developer\nTh e farmers\u2019 co-op model is likely to be the cheapest option, \nas silage can be produced on farm; however, the case of a \ndeveloper owning and operating the plant should also be \nconsidered.

As grass is a lignocellulosic feedstock, grass biometh-\nane used as a biofuel earns the country double credits55 for \nmeeting the 2020 targets for renewable energy in transport. \nInjecting biomethane into the gas grid is an eff ective means \nof getting renewable energy to a large number of consumers \nwithout any change in existing infrastructure. In addition, \ngrass AD provides an opportunity for farm diversifi cation, \nleading to a strong case for subsidizing for grass biogas\/\nbiomethane and AD plants in general.\nEnvironmental bene\ufb01 ts\nTh rough the replacement of fossil fuels, the use of biogas\/\nbiomethane reduces GHG emissions. Th e extent of the \nreduction depends on the feedstock used and the fuel being \nreplaced. GHG savings of 82% for cattle slurry biomethane \ncompared with diesel have been reported,56 while savings \nof 75 to 150% are achieved for grass biomethane compared \nto diesel (depending on the level of carbon sequestration18). \nMethane is also a much cleaner burning fuel in terms of \nlocal pollutants (e.g. nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate \nmatter (PM)) than coal or oil, improving air quality and \nbenefi ting health,57-59 especially if used in urban areas. In \naddition, the digestion of wastes is a proven waste treatment \noption that decreases GHG emissions from uncontrolled \nfermentation and reduces pollution from poor waste-man-\nagement practices.26\nMonetary value of environmental bene\ufb01 ts\nImprovements in the environment benefi t both biodiversity \nand the human population, but assigning a value to the non-\nmarket co-benefi ts of an AD plant is open to debate; there is \nconsiderable uncertainty and values are likely to change in \nthe future as concerns over environmental issues heighten.26 \nAt the end of pipe, savings from methane through avoiding \nemissions like CO2, NOx, and PM have been estimated as \n\u20ac0.43 L-1 of diesel replaced for a passenger car in an urban \narea,35 which equates to \u20ac1387 ha-1 of grass digested. In city \ncentres, this rises to \u20ac0.89 L-1 diesel replaced 35 or \u20ac2870 ha-1 of \ngrass. If a waste feedstock is used, the benefi t from avoided \nmethane leakage is \u20ac0.26 L-1 of diesel replaced and the total \nbenefi t, including improved end-of-pipe emissions, is \u20ac1.15 \nL-1 of diesel replaced.35 Th is equates to \u20ac17.1 t-1 of cattle \nslurry digested (based on a biogas yield of 25 m3 t-1 of slurry \nat 60% CH4).\nCompetitive advantage of biomethane\nRenewable energy targets\nWhen non-market benefi ts are excluded, grass biomethane \nis not competitive with natural gas. However, renewable \nenergy targets in each of the three energy sectors (heat, \ntransport and electricity) mean that biomethane (renewable \ngas) is in competition, not with fossil fuels, but with other \nrenewables. Th e competitive advantage of biomethane is that \n 19321031, 2010, 5, Downloaded from https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bbb.238 by China Universitaet Of Petroleum, Wiley Online Library on [23\/10\/2023].

Th ere has been signifi cant invest-\nment in the grid in recent years, with the construction of \na new pipeline in the west, and the connection of many \nnew towns is ongoing. A program has also been completed \nreplacing all of the old cast-iron pipes with polyethylene \npipes, resulting in a more effi  cient network. In 2004, losses \nfrom the distribution network were so small they could \nnot be measured.6 In a country of ca. 4 million people with \n1.46 million houses,60 there are currently around 619 100 \ndomestic connections and 24 000 industrial and commer-\ncial connections to the gas grid in the Republic of Ireland. \nIn Northern Ireland, there are a further 118 800 domestic \ncustomers and 8400 industrial and commercial customers.61 \nUnlike other renewable energy technologies which must \ndevelop a customer base from scratch, biomethane plants \ninjecting into the gas grid have an existing market which \nrequires only a change in the billing system.\nSpace requirements\nFor new installations, bioNG has the edge over other renew-\nable technologies in areas on the gas grid, especially in \nurban areas where space may be at a premium. Signifi cant \nspace is required for many renewable energy solutions, such \nas wood chips (fuel storage areas) or horizontal geothermal \ninstallations; such space may be costly or unavailable in cit-\nies and towns (e.g. in apartment blocks). \nFinding the right market \u2013 electricity, transport, or heat?\nTh ere are clearly competitive advantages of grass biometh-\nane; the issue is now to fi nd the right market so as the exploit \nthese advantages. Th e potential of the electricity, transport \nand heat markets are discussed in the following section.\nGrass biomethane in the renewable electricity \nmarket\nMeeting the targets\nIreland\u2019s 40% renewable electricity target for 202012 is \nexpected to be provided largely by wind. Ireland has one \nof the best wind resources in Europe and wind electricity \ncan be generated relatively cheaply compared with other \nrenewable sources. Th ere are also targets for electricity from \nocean energy (500 MW of installed capacity by 2020) and for \n30% biomass co-fi ring in existing peat-fi red power plants.13 \nTh e presence of viable alternatives for renewable electric-\nity means that there is not expected to be a large market \nfor electricity from grass biogas; however, there may be \nsome scope in the CHP market and in existing power plants \nrunning on natural gas. Th e market size is considerable as \n62% of primary natural gas energy is used for electricity \ngeneration.62\nCost competitiveness of CHP plants\nTh ere is a government target to achieve at least 800 MW \nfrom CHP by 2020, with emphasis on biomass-fueled \nCHP.13 Th e use of grass biogas in an on-site CHP plant \nstruggles economically, due largely to the current tariff  \nstructure and the lack of heat markets in Ireland. However, \nthere is potential for existing natural-gas-fueled CHP plants \nto purchase renewable gas from the grid, with the advan-\ntages that the capital investment has already been made and \nthere is generally a market for heat at existing plants. As \n93% of the installed CHP capacity in Ireland runs on gas \nfuels,63 there is signifi cant market potential; however, the \nrenewable bonus of \u20ac0.12 kWhe\n-1 for biomethane does not \nmake fi nancial sense, as CHP plants typically displace elec-\ntricity purchased from the grid and have a return of about \n\u20ac0.10\u20130.11 kWhe\n-1. \nSuggested \ufb01 nancial incentives\nIt is suggested that a revised system of tariff s be introduced. \nCurrently, a fl at rate of \u20ac0.12 kWhe\n-1 is paid for biogas CHP. \nTh e same electricity tariff  is paid regardless of whether a \ngate fee is received or the feedstock is purchased, and there \nis no allowance for the non-monetary benefi ts of AD; for \nexample, to encourage use of cattle slurry. Th e German tariff  \nstructure64 uses graded tariff s, which depend on feedstock \ntype, plant size, and AD technology type, among other fac-\ntors. Th e International Energy Agency (IEA) has stated65 that \nthe high investor security provided by the German feed-in \ntariff  has been a success, resulting in a rapid deployment of \nrenewables, the entrance of many new actors to the market, \n 19321031, 2010, 5, Downloaded from https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bbb.238 by China Universitaet Of Petroleum, Wiley Online Library on [23\/10\/2023].

Using the German tariff s \nfor the grass plant in this analysis, the electricity tariff  rises to \n\u20ac0.1718 kWhe\n-1 for an on-site CHP plant and \u20ac0.1818 kWhe\n-1 \nfor an off -site CHP plant using biomethane tapped from the \ngrid (Table 5).\nPotential for pro\ufb01 tability\nSuch a tariff  structure would bring the on-site CHP plant \ninto profi t as long as there is a market for the heat (Table 6). \nTh e annual income for E+H and G+E+H is 2 to 2.6 times \nthe average FFI for cattle-rearing farms (\u20ac279 ha-1) when \nreduced operating costs and depreciation are considered. In \nthe case of the off -site CHP plant, a return of \u20ac0.085 kWh-1 \nbiomethane can be achieved, assuming 40% thermal and \n35% electrical effi  ciency (\u20ac0.1818 kWhe\n-1 + \u20ac0.053 kWhth\n-1). \nTh is is over 25% higher than the best-case break-even price \nfor grass biomethane (from Table 4). Th e viability of off -site \nCHP plants can only be assessed on a case-by-case basis. \nDetermining factors include the plant size, the proportion \nof biomethane\/natural gas in the mix, and the individual \ncircumstances of the plant; for example, if capital costs have \nalready been paid.\nCCGT plants\nTh ere is potential for the use of biomethane in combined \ncycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants. An economic analysis \nof biomethane in CCGT plants is outside the scope of this \nstudy; however, initial advantages of biomethane used in a \nCCGT facility include:\n\u2022 an electrical effi  ciency of around 55% compared to 35% \nin a small scale CHP;\n\u2022 increasing the priority listing of the CCGT plant as it is \nnow seen as a renewable source of electricity as opposed \nto a fossil fuel electricity generating plant; and\n\u2022 use of electricity from CCGT to power electric cars and \nprovide renewable fuel in transport.\nProblems with the market\nTh e lack of a comprehensive tariff  structure is a stumbling \nblock for the industry. Th ere is also a disparity between AD \nplant output and the demand of off -site electricity generators. \nTh ree-quarters of CHP plants in Ireland are in the size range \n0.5\u20131 MWe.63 Assuming 30% co-fi ring (which is the target for \nbiomass co-fi ring in peat plants) in 0.75 MWe CHP plants, the \ngrass biomethane facility in this analysis would serve only 2.7 \nsuch plants. Being reliant on such a small customer base puts \nthe biomethane supplier at risk of failure from small changes \nin demand. An obligation for CHP plants to meet renewable \nenergy targets would improve the viability through providing \ngreater market stability for the developing industry, and by \nputting biomethane in competition with other renewables, as \nopposed to cheap natural gas.\nTable 5.

Penetration of renewables \nin transport currently stands at less than 1.2%,11 and there is \nno clear national roadmap for reaching the target. Th e prob-\nlem is further compounded by policy constraints in biofuels \n(sustainability criteria) and agriculture (land use) which \nrestrict the type of biofuels that can be used and the type \nof energy crops that can be grown. Work by Smyth et al. 19 \ninvestigated Ireland\u2019s options for meeting the 2020 target \n(including imported biofuels, electric vehicles, waste\/residue-\nderived biofuels, and indigenous energy crop biofuels) and \nfound that the largest potential lies with grass biomethane. \nCost competitiveness\nTh e break-even price of compressed biomethane from grass \nvaries between \u20ac0.078 and \u20ac0.132 kWh-1 (Table 7). Excise \nduty is not charged on gas used as a propellant, but VAT at \n21% has to be added,66 giving a minimum selling price (i.e. \nbreak-even price) of between \u20ac0.096 and \u20ac0.163 kWh-1. Th e \nsale prices of petrol and diesel lie within this range (Table 8). \nTh e price of CNG is signifi cantly lower than that of pet-\nrol and diesel, meaning that considerable savings can be \nachieved if bioCNG is sold. If a 10% biomethane\/90% CNG \nblend is used, the break-even price is between \u20ac0.0199 and \n\u20ac0.0217 MJ-1 (based on UK CNG prices). At 53% of the price \nof petrol and 71% of the price of diesel (for the higher price of \n\u20ac0.0217 MJ-1), this is competitive.\nProblems with the market\nTh e obvious stumbling block for the sale of biomethane \nas a transport fuel in Ireland is the absence of a market; \nthere are currently only two natural gas vehicles in the \ncountry.67 However, there are over 10 million CNG vehicles \nworldwide 67 and the use of compressed biomethane, either \non its own or mixed with natural gas (bioCNG), is growing. \nSweden has around 17 000 natural gas vehicles, and over 55% \nof the gas used in transport is biomethane.68 Th e develop-\nment of biomethane for transport in other countries has gen-\nerally been based on an existing CNG market, and the devel-\nopment of CNG is oft en based on the introduction of CNG \nto captive fl eets (e.g. buses, waste collection lorries, taxis) \nfollowed by private cars. Th e sale of biomethane for transport \nin other countries has been found to be profi table, off er-\ning higher returns than heat or electricity. Th e CNG market \nmay develop in Ireland as it has done elsewhere, but would \nrequire regulation and incentives from government to do so.\nGrass biomethane in the renewable heat market\nMeeting the targets\nTh e government has set a target for 12% renewable heat by \n2020 and has also stated that the public sector will lead the \nway with the deployment of bioenergy heating.13 Th e resi-\ndential sector is responsible for the largest share of natural \ngas fi nal energy consumption, at 40.7%.62 Twenty-eight per \ncent of houses have gas central heating,69 with the highest \nproportion in Dublin, where there are almost 375 000 natu-\nral gas customers or about 60% of total national customers. \nAverage residential natural gas demand (weather corrected) \nin 2008 was 14.4 MWh (51.8 GJ) per household.

Th e analysis assumes biomethane \nis produced from grass only; biomethane produced from \nfeedstock with a gate fee, such as slaughter waste, would be \nconsiderably more competitive.\nProblems with the market\nAlthough Directive 2009\/73\/EC on the natural gas market70 \nstates that biogas should be granted non-discriminatory \naccess to the gas system, and biomethane is injected into \nthe grid in other countries, as yet there is no system for this \nin Ireland. Gaslink (the Irish gas network operator) and \nBord G\u00e1is are currently investigating a quality standard for \nbiomethane injection into the grid.\nConclusions\nTh e key to the competitiveness of biogas\/biomethane is the \nrenewable energy targets, which place it in competition, not \nwith cheap natural gas, but with other renewables. Th e prin-\ncipal advantage of biomethane over other renewables is that \nit can be distributed through the gas grid to a large existing \ncustomer base.\nTh e renewable electricity market is largely dominated by \nwind and it is the view of the authors that electricity is not \nthe most advantageous avenue for biogas. If a biogas elec-\ntricity industry were to develop from grass, a revised tariff  \nstructure would be necessary. Th e existing tariff  structure \nworks well for feedstock that attracts a gate fee but, in spite \nof this, the industry is faltering, largely due to the strict \ninterpretation of the ABP regulations and uncertainty in the \nwaste sector.\nTh e transport market off ers the potential for profi tability \nand provides a cheaper alternative to petrol and diesel for \nthe consumer. Th ere is currently no market for CNG in \nIreland, therefore the transport market is not a practical \noption at present.\nUnlike other renewable technologies in the heat sector, \ngrass biomethane has a large, easily accessible customer base. \nExisting natural gas customers would not require the instal-\nlation of a new renewable heating system or any changes in \npractice, and their gas supplier would need only a change in \ntheir billing system; thus the higher cost of renewable gas \ncan be off set against avoided capital investment. Injecting \ngrass biomethane into the grid for sale as a heating fuel is the \npath of least resistance. However, there is currently no legis-\nlation in place in Ireland to allow grid injection.\nUnder certain conditions, grass biogas\/biomethane has \nthe potential to be an economically viable alternative for \nfarmers and for the consumer. Its cost competitiveness can \nbe further improved by co-digestion with gate-fee feedstock \nand by taking account of the associated non-monetary co-\nbenefi ts. A recurring theme, however, is the lack of consist-\nent legislation regarding anaerobic digestion and the use \nof biogas\/biomethane, and this is acting as a barrier to the \ndevelopment and economic success of the industry. For the \nindustry to succeed economically, the implementation of \ncohesive legislation is required.\nAcknowledgements\nTh is research was funded by Bord G\u00e1is \u00c9ireann.
