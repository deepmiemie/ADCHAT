Based on this knowledge, a model for cal-\\nculating the risk of foaming in anaerobic digestion systems due to microbiological causes has been devel-\\noped. Organic loading rate, variation in organic loading rate, and the presence of ﬁlamentous\\nmicroorganisms in the activated sludge system, used as a feed source for the digester, have been selected\\nas the inputs of a knowledge-based model designed to provide as output the risk of foaming in an anaer-\\nobic digester. The performance of the model is demonstrated by means of a case study using the IWA\\nBenchmark Simulation Model No. 2 as a framework, where risk of foaming is used as a new evaluation\\ncriterion. The simulated results of an open-loop conﬁguration and two closed-loop control strategies\\nillustrate the usefulness of this knowledge-based approach as a means of estimating the risk of foaming\\nin anaerobic digestion.\\n� 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\\n1. Introduction\\nDeterministic models have been widely used to describe anaer-\\nobic digestion (AD) processes, mainly for very speciﬁc purposes.\\nFor instance, in Mu et al. (2007), an AD model is used to describe\\nthe growth of hydrogen producing microorganisms, the consump-\\ntion of substrate and the formation of product. Bernard et al.\\n(2001) propose a two-step model that can be easily used for\\nclosed-loop control and optimisation of AD processes. Other stud-\\nies have focused on sulphate reduction in AD (Knobel and Lewis,\\n2002). Speciﬁcally, one of the motivating factors behind the devel-\\nopment of the Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) was to fo-\\ncus on setting up a more complete and versatile model, based on\\nthe ﬁrst AD models (Batstone et al., 2002).\\nHowever, none of these AD modelling approaches is able to\\novercome one of the limitations of deterministic modelling, an\\ninability to properly describe the population dynamics responsible\\nfor operational imbalances (e.g. the presence of foam caused by ﬁl-\\namentous bacteria). There have been a few promising studies\\nabout the modelling of microbial diversity, such as the work by Ra-\\nmirez et al. (2009), where the signiﬁcant role of microbial diversity\\nregarding the modelling and control of AD processes is highlighted.\\nNevertheless, this advance does not provide a comprehensive, gen-\\neral model of the mechanisms involved in the development of\\nfoaming in anaerobic digestion systems and therefore other ap-\\nproaches have to be studied. Indeed, among the various operating\\nproblems that affect AD in wastewater treatment plants, foaming\\nis the most extensive and problematic. The consequences of foam-\\ning are numerous: blockage of the gas mixing devices, fouling of\\ngas collection pipes, decrease in volatile solids reduction, loss of\\neffective digester volume, low biogas production, etc. For this rea-\\nson, several studies have been published on causes of foaming in\\nanaerobic digestion (FAD). According to the review by Ganidi\\net al. (2009) causes of FAD are related to two main sources, the feed\\nsludge characteristics (including surface active agents, organic\\nloading rates and ﬁlamentous microorganisms) and the digesters\\ndesign and operating characteristics (shape, temperature, mixing).\\nTherefore different types of process data combined with heuristic\\nknowledge of the operators are exploited to detect this microbiol-\\nogy-related operational problem on full-scale systems: on-line\\ndata, off-line analytical data reﬂecting the feed sludge quality\\nand quantity, off-line microbiological information (ﬂoc and sludge\\naspects, ﬁlamentous bacteria species identiﬁcation, etc.) and in situ\\nvisual observations are all taken into account. However, the useful-\\nness for prediction is limited: it only provides a warning when the\\n0960-8524/$ - see front matter � 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The presence of heuristics\\nand qualitative knowledge on complex phenomena such as anaer-\\nobic digestion foaming stands in sharp contrast with the lack of ba-\\nsic mechanistic knowledge on the population dynamics of the\\nmicroorganisms causing these phenomena.\\nThe complexity involved in the description of operational prob-\\nlems of microbiological origin can be tackled by Knowledge-Based\\nSystems (KBSs), as complementary tools to mechanistic models.\\nKBSs use heuristic knowledge and human experience to apply rea-\\nsoning to the problems that can affect a system. Enhanced descrip-\\ntion of complex operational problems can be achieved by linking\\nnumerical models and knowledge-based systems into integrated\\ntools, which allow for management and active use of essential\\nknowledge related to these problems. Literature examples on the\\napplication of knowledge-based tools (e.g. expert systems, fuzzy\\nlogic or qualitative modelling) or data-based models (e.g. neural\\nnetworks or data-driven models) complementing mechanistic\\nmodels in anaerobic digestion modelling are also already available\\n(e.g. Puñal et al., 2003). For example, in Puñal et al. (2003) a KBS is\\napplied to the monitoring and diagnosis of an AD plant. The sys-\\ntem is able to identify the current state of the process (i.e. normal,\\nhydraulic overload, organic overload, etc.); it can also predict its\\ntrend, failures in the instrumentation and propose control actions.\\nThe results of validation show that the system can present valu-\\nable solutions that end up in recovering normal operation. Data\\nmining techniques have also shown to be useful tools to deter-\\nmine the relevance of the process variables on AD foaming. Re-\\ncently, the work presented in Dalmau et al. (2010) presented an\\nexample of how a wrapper approach is applied to select the most\\nrelevant variables to foaming in AD. Besides, a knowledge-based\\nrisk assessment model for settling problems of microbiological ori-\\ngin in activated sludge systems (ﬁlamentous bulking, foaming and\\nrising sludge) has been successfully developed and applied (Comas\\net al., 2008).\\nThe aim of this paper is to present a knowledge-based risk mod-\\nel, which integrates expert knowledge with the mechanisms of AD\\nin standard deterministic models, to infer foaming of microbiolog-\\nical origin during the simulation of anaerobic digestion systems.\\nFirst, the development of the risk model is presented including\\nthe knowledge embodied in the risk model and its implementation\\nin fuzzy logic. Then, the performance of the risk model in different\\ncase studies is discussed, using the IWA Benchmark Simulation\\nModel No. 2 (BSM2) as the simulation platform of wastewater\\ntreatment plants (Jeppsson et al., 2007). The case study scenarios\\ninclude an open-loop scenario to show the general performance\\nof the AD risk model and a case study in which the open-loop case\\nstudy and two control strategies are compared. Finally, conclusions\\nare drawn based on model simulations results using the risk model\\ndeveloped.\\n2. Risk model development\\nThe development of the risk model for foaming simulation is di-\\nvided in four steps: knowledge acquisition, selection of key vari-\\nables,\\nimplementation,\\nand\\nsimulation.\\nFor\\nthe\\nknowledge\\nacquisition, the literature related to foaming in AD is reviewed con-\\nsidering the most relevant causes for foaming. In the second step,\\nthe suitable variables for foaming simulation are selected taking\\ninto account their availability in the current mechanistic models\\nand ability to control them to minimise/remediate foaming prob-\\nlems. The third step involves the implementation of the risk model\\nin a fuzzy logic rule-based system, presenting the different mem-\\nbership functions and the rules embodied in the risk model. The\\nlast step is the design of the model outcomes used for simulation\\nevaluation.\\n2.1. Knowledge acquisition\\nFig. 1 presents a scheme of the current knowledge on possible\\ncauses for foaming in AD that are reviewed in the work by Ganidi\\net al. (2009). It has been divided between the feed sludge charac-\\nteristics and the anaerobic digester design and operational condi-\\ntions.\\nThree\\ngroups\\nof\\ncauses\\nfor\\nfoaming\\nwere\\nidentiﬁed\\nincluding the input sludge characteristics (surface active agents,\\norganic loading rates (OLR) and ﬁlamentous bacteria). Mixing en-\\nergy, temperature, and VFA levels (as a main surface active agent\\npresent in the anaerobic digester) and shape of the digester were\\nidentiﬁed as the other main causes for foaming related to the\\nanaerobic digester design and operational conditions.\\nGanidi et al. (2009) stated that surface active agents in anaero-\\nbic digestion feed act as foaming initiators when a concentration\\nthreshold (still unknown) is exceeded. They also point out that\\naccumulation of surface active agents is related to their degradabil-\\nity. Therefore, lipids contribution to foaming is less when com-\\npared to proteins due to a faster degradability of the former,\\nwhich are less likely to accumulate in the bulk phase and cause\\nfoaming. In terms of detergents, their low degradability under\\nanaerobic conditions, which implies an increased surface activity\\nof the anaerobic sludge, can be related to foaming. But there is\\nno conﬁrmation of foaming events due to this factor in the\\nliterature.\\nWith regard to ﬁlamentous bacteria (Microthrix parvicella and\\nGordonia spp.) many studies point to their direct involvement in\\nfoaming events (Pagilla et al., 1997; Westlund et al., 1998; Eikel-\\nboom, 2000; Moen, 2003; Barber, 2005). Ganidi et al. (2009), fol-\\nlowing the example of Davenport and Curtis (2002) in terms of\\nfoaming in AS, stated that foaming in AD can be regarded as a 3-\\nphase system comprising of gas, liquid and solid particles. The\\ngas and liquid phases contain the surface active agents responsible\\nfor foam initiation and the solid phase contains the particles\\n(hydrophobic bacteria such as M. parvicella and Gordonia spp.)\\nresponsible for foam stabilisation.\\nThe relationship between OLR and foaming is supported by\\nmany authors as shown in Fig. 1. In Ganidi et al. (2009), it was sug-\\ngested that the residual feed organic constituents, not fully de-\\ngraded in the digester, leads to the accumulation of hydrophobic\\nsubstances that can promote foaming. However, there is still a lack\\nof information on the critical concentrations for hydrophobic sub-\\nstances. Some authors propose ‘safe’ ranges of OLR although they\\nare broad and probably each digester would have its own critical\\norganic loading threshold. Overloading and ﬂuctuation of digester\\nloading should be avoided by daily and weekly monitoring of solids\\nloading rates and the digester’s performance. Intermittent loading\\nrates lead to intermittent levels of gas production and if the gas\\ncollection piping is not of adequate capacity, there is potential\\nfor onset of foaming during higher gas production periods.\\nIn terms of the digester design and operational conditions, gas\\nmixing is pointed out by some authors (Pagilla et al., 1997; Barber,\\n2005; Moen, 2003) as a cause of foaming. With regard to the mix-\\ning energy, poor and excessive mixing can both cause foaming\\n(Pagilla et al., 1997; Brown, 2002; Moen, 2003). Concerning the di-\\ngester shape, no information so far has suggested a relationship be-\\ntween digester shape and foaming occurrence (Metcalf and Eddy,\\n2003). Both conventional and egg shaped digesters have experi-\\nenced foaming problems in the recent years. In relation to temper-\\nature, higher temperatures reduce surface tension and viscosity of\\nsludge increasing the foaming risk. However, the only experimen-\\ntal evidence on the effect of temperature in digestion is from Chae\\net al. (2008), but no reference to foaming events is made in the pa-\\nper. Surface active agents accumulation in the digester (mainly\\nVFA) has also been pointed out as a foaming cause, however, there\\nis no experimental or quantitative evidence in the literature to\\nJ. Dalmau et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4306–4314\\n4307\\nsupport the interpretation that accumulation of acetic acid leads to\\nfoaming (Ganidi et al., 2009).\\n2.3. Selection of related variables\\nWith regard to the selection of the most relevant variables to\\nidentify foaming (i.e. the inputs for the risk model), some consider-\\nations were made to take into account variables or factors depend-\\ning on whether or not they are usually modelled, and are key\\nfactors that cause and can be used to control foaming.\\nThe ﬁrst one highlights the relevance of controlling loading\\nrates, as previously stated, overloading and ﬂuctuation in digester\\nloading should be avoided by daily and weekly monitoring of solids\\nloading rates and the digesters performance. Besides, the literature\\nhas many examples of studies and full-scale plant experiences\\nrelating foaming and poor operational practices in terms of loading\\nrates (as shown in Fig. 1). Thus, to consider the effect of unstable\\nand high loading rates as potential foaming causing factors, OLR\\nand its daily variations have to be two of the risk model inputs.\\nSince ﬁlamentous bacteria are also related to foaming in anaer-\\nobic digesters, as many studies point to Gordonia spp. (formerly\\nNocardia sp.) as initiators of foaming, and responsible for foam sta-\\nbilisation, the presence of ﬁlamentous bacteria in the AD feed (i.e.\\nwaste activated sludge from foaming-plagued activated sludge\\nsystems) should be taken into account in the risk model. This is\\npossible given that the risk model for the activated sludge by Co-\\nmas et al. (2008) provides the risk of foaming due to M. parvicella.\\nThe risk of foaming in activated sludge (FAS) is included as a con-\\ntributing factor in the AD foaming risk model.\\nConcerning the surface active agents present in the AD inﬂow\\n(mainly proteins and detergents; Fig. 1), in general these substances\\nrepresent mostly low biodegradable substrates (described as par-\\nticulate substrates in standard anaerobic digestion models). Deter-\\ngents are not usually speciﬁcally described as state variables unless\\nthey are used for very speciﬁc purposes, and therefore, they cannot\\nbe taken into account directly. Nonetheless, in Ganidi et al. (2009) it\\nis stated that the detergents contribution to foaming is linked to the\\nsurface tension of the liquid phase. Since the surface tension in the\\nliquid phase is usually not measured or modelled in AD models and\\nit will not be considered in the risk model. Nevertheless, the role of\\nproteins as surface active agents is taken into account without\\nincluding additional variables by including them in the particulate\\nsubstrate calculations and therefore, in the OLR calculation.\\nConsidering the anaerobic digester mixing, as commented, both\\nexcessive and poor mixing can cause foaming if a critical concen-\\ntration of surface active agents is present. Since the mixing energy\\nis only calculated in some ADM1 implementations, the mixing en-\\nergy effect has not been considered. Besides, the distinction be-\\ntween gas and mechanically mixed digesters is not considered in\\nthe risk model since it is not commonly modelled.\\nThe effect of temperature oscillations on foaming in mesophilic\\nconditions has not been studied. For thermophilic conditions, the\\neffect is only supposed to be on viscosity and surface tension of\\nthe liquid phase. However, despite the fact that temperature effect\\nwould be of great interest for a mechanistic model of foaming in\\nAD, it is not included in this risk model because standard anaerobic\\ndigestion models do not consider temperature as a state variable.\\nAs pointed out in the knowledge acquisition, there is no proven\\neffect of the digester’s shape on foaming (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003).\\nTherefore, it has not been considered in the risk model.\\nWith regard to the effect of VFA accumulation in the digester as\\na cause for foaming, many works link VFA accumulation to foam-\\ning, but no experimental or quantitative evidence has been re-\\nported in this regard. Besides, accumulation of VFAs is generally\\nconsidered to be a result of organic loading rate imbalances, which\\nis already included in the risk model as a variable. Thus, VFA levels\\nas a distinct variable has not been considered for the risk model.\\nTo summarise, OLR (considering proteins, lipids and inert mate-\\nrial), daily OLR variation, and the presence of ﬁlamentous bacteria in\\nthe inﬂuent (related to FAS risk) will be the input variables of the risk\\nmodel. Although the selectionof these three input variables from the\\npossible variables may restrict a broader applicability of the risk\\nmodel proposed, it still provides valuable information about the risk\\nof foaming when simulating anaerobic digestion processes.\\n2.4. Implementation\\nThe description of expert knowledge is tackled using the princi-\\nples of fuzzy decision theory (Bellmann and Zadeh, 1970). Due to\\nits simplicity and efﬁciency, this theory is already widely used in\\nFig. 1. Schematic representation of the possible causes for FAD (See above-mentioned references for further information.)\\n4308\\nJ. Dalmau et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4306–4314\\nenvironmental modelling applications. The risk model estimates\\nthe risk of occurrence of microbiology-related anaerobic digestion\\nfoaming by processing the data used by the mechanistic model\\n(not only simulation outputs but also inﬂuent data and operational\\nparameters). In this work, the fuzzy toolbox by MATLAB� (Math-\\nWorks Inc.) has been used to implement the risk model.\\nThe risk estimation implies three main steps:\\n(i)\\nfuzziﬁcation, where the crisp values of numerical data are\\nconverted into linguistic labels (i.e. low, high, etc.) by means\\nof corresponding membership functions. Membership func-\\ntions are deﬁned for each input and output variable used\\n(i.e. OLR, OLR daily variation, risk of foaming in the AS –\\nFAS risk – and FAD risk). Triangular or pseudo-trapezoidal\\nfunctions are used to deﬁne the membership functions.Lim-\\nits for the different membership functions were proposed\\n(e.g. what values represent a very low, low, medium, high\\nand very high OLR). Concerning OLR limits, Metcalf (2003)\\nstate that the appropriate OLRs for anaerobic digesters are\\nbetween 1.6 and 4.8 kg VS m�3 d�1. The manual of operation\\nof the Water Environment Federation (1996) suggests an\\nOLR between 1.6 and 6.2 kg VS m�3 d�1. For instance, Mass-\\nart et al. (2006) state that to prevent FAD, the OLR should be\\nmaintained between 1.6 and 2.4 kg VS m�3 d�1. Murto et al.\\n(2005) found that an OLR higher than 2.6 kg VS m�3 d�1 can\\nproduce excessive foaming. Regarding OLRvar, Massart et al.\\n(2006) recommended a daily variation of 5–10%. These lim-\\nits, once related to Fig. 2, result in the membership function\\nfeatures listed in Table 1. A last consideration was made\\ngiven that the OLR limits that appear in the bibliography\\ndo not distinguish between proteins, lipids, carbohydrates\\nand other surface agents as the usual AD models can do.\\nHence, in OLR calculation from simulation results carbohy-\\ndrates where included. OLRvar will be calculated on a daily\\nbasis as the percentage of variation of the average OLR for\\none day with respect to the average OLR of the previous\\nday. A customization of the parameters related to the fuzzy\\napproach such as the limits or overlapping of the member-\\nship functions is left to the ﬁnal user (the same OLR, OLRvar\\nor presence of ﬁlamentous organisms in the aeration basins\\ndo not affect in the same way – in terms of microbiology-\\nrelated foaming – in all the anaerobic digestion systems).\\n(ii) fuzzy inference, in order to obtain an output for the FAD risk,\\na set of rules were deﬁned including the knowledge acquired\\n(presented in Fig. 2). This set of rules will form the knowl-\\nedge base of the risk model. The basic decision matrix is\\nthe front layer of Fig. 2 that takes into account the OLR (left\\naxis of Fig. 2) and its variation on a daily basis (bottom axis\\nin Fig. 2). From this basic decision matrix the FAD risk\\nincreases as the FAS risk (right axis in Fig. 2) increases (sec-\\nond and third layers in Fig. 2). Each box corresponds to the\\nresult of a rule. e.g. hIF OLR is very low AND OLR variation\\nis medium AND FAS risk is high THEN FAD risk is medium\\n(grey box)i. To concatenate the set of rules, the Mamdani\\nmethod was selected as the fuzzy inference method (Mam-\\ndani and Assilan, 1975). Again the limits for the qualitative\\nranges of the three decision matrices are left for calibration\\nto the end user according to site speciﬁc conditions.\\n(iii) Defuzziﬁcation, in which the linguistic label obtained from\\nthe inference is converted into a numerical value for the only\\noutput of the risk model ‘FAD risk’. Again, this is performed\\nby means of the above mentioned membership functions.\\nThe method used to obtain the numerical value for the\\nFAD risk is the centre of gravity (Fiter et al., 2005).\\n2.5. Model outcomes\\nThe outcome of the model, the FAD risk, indicates the potential\\nfor development of foaming in the anaerobic digester. The FAD risk\\nvalue provided by the model ranges from 0 (very low possibility) to\\n1 (most likely). The risk model outputs are the FAD risk proﬁle vs.\\ntime and the percentage of time over the whole simulation period\\nat high (>0.8) FAD risk. Fig. 3 shows the response surfaces for FAD\\nrisk depending on OLR and OLRvar for each FAS risk membership\\nfunction (i.e. Fig. 3a for low, Fig. 3b for medium and Fig. 3c for high\\nFAS risk). Fig. 3 illustrates how the high FAD risk zone (top) of the\\nsurfaces becomes wider as FAS risk increases from low to high. The\\ninverse effect is shown for the low FAD risk zone (bottom).\\nTo consider the low dynamics of foaming development, the out-\\ncome risk is ﬁltered by means of an exponential ﬁlter with a time\\nconstant of three days (Comas et al., 2008) although it can be cus-\\ntomised by the user of the risk model. This ﬁlter prevents unreal-\\nistic sudden changes from very high to very low values for FAD\\nrisk.\\nHigh Very\\nhigh\\nFAS\\nLow\\nMedium\\nHigh\\nLow\\nMedium\\nVery\\nlow\\nLow\\nMedium\\nHigh\\nOLR\\nOLR variation\\nHigh Very\\nhigh\\nFAS\\nLow\\nMedium\\nHigh\\nLow\\nMedium\\nVery\\nlow\\nLow\\nMedium\\nHigh\\nOLR\\nOLR variation\\nFig. 2.

As a compromise, these limits were\\nchosen from standard values, as described in the implementation\\nsection. However, it is worth remembering that users can change\\nthese limits according to their own AD conﬁguration since the lim-\\nits for OLR that can cause foaming may vary from one digester to\\nanother.\\n3. Performance of the risk model\\nThis section presents the performance of the risk model in a\\ncase study using the BSM2 as a framework to illustrate the useful-\\nness of the knowledge-based approach for estimating the AD risk.\\nAfter the BSM2 has been introduced, the section is divided into two\\nparts. The ﬁrst is dedicated to the results of the risk model from\\nopen-loop simulations. The second is devoted to a comparison of\\nWWTP control strategies related to FAD risk through simulation\\nstudies.\\n3.1. Framework: the IWA Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2\\nBSM2 is a standardised simulation protocol for testing and val-\\nidating control strategies applied to wastewater treatment plants.\\nIt is a plant-wide layout and model composed of seven compo-\\nnents: (i) a primary clariﬁer based on the description of Otterpohl\\nand Freund (1992) and Otterpohl et al. (1994); (ii) a ﬁve-reactor\\n(two anoxic plus three aerobic) nitrogen removal activated sludge\\nconﬁguration based on ASM1 (Henze et al., 1987); (iii) a secondary\\nclariﬁer based on the double exponential model of Takács et al.\\n(1991); (iv) an ideal gravity thickening unit; (v) anaerobic diges-\\ntion based on ADM1 (Batstone et al., 2002); (vi) an ideal dewater-\\ning unit and, (vii) a storage tank. A BSM2 simulation is run for a\\ntotal of 809 days. The initial 200 days are used to reach a steady\\nstate with constant input data, while 245 of the remaining\\n609 days are used to reach a quasi-steady-state using dynamic in-\\nput data and to provide adaptive controllers with enough time to\\nestimate parameter values. Therefore, only the last 364 days are\\navailable to be used for evaluation purposes. The evaluation crite-\\nria of the BSM2 encompass, among others, an efﬂuent quality index\\n(EQI in kg of pollutant units d�1) which is a weighted sum of the\\npollutants in the efﬂuent, and an operational cost index (OCI,\\ndimensionless) which includes costs accrued from pumping en-\\nergy, aeration, mixing, sludge disposal, external carbon source\\naddition and methane production. A detailed description of the\\nwhole layout, simulation protocol, sensor models, control handles\\nand evaluation criteria calculations for the BSM2 can be found in\\nJeppsson et al. (2007) and Nopens et al. (2008).\\n3.2. Open-loop case\\nAn open-loop case study with constant values for the main\\nplant-wide WWTP operational parameters was simulated to\\nFig. 3. Response surfaces for FAD risk for each FAS risk membership function value: (a) low; (b) medium and (c) high FAS risk.\\n4310\\nJ. Dalmau et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4306–4314\\nillustrate the performance of the risk model. In terms of opera-\\ntional parameters related to the FAD risk, the waste activated\\nsludge (WAS) ﬂow rate, Qw, was ﬁxed at 300 m3 d�1 and the return\\nactivated sludge ﬂow rate, Qr, was equal to the inﬂuent wastewa-\\nter ﬂow rate, Q. Fig. 4 shows the FAD risk proﬁle as a function of\\ntime over different seasons together with OLR, OLRvar, and FAS risk\\nproﬁles.\\nIn general, the FAD risk trend is similar to that for FAS risk.\\nHowever, at the end of the summer (days 30–50, approximately),\\nthere is a divergence in FAD risk with respect to the FAS risk due\\nto a greater decrease in both OLR and OLRvar, which compensates\\nfor the increase in FAS risk during the same period. From approx-\\nimately day 170 until the onset of summer (day 310), FAD risk sta-\\nbilises satisfactorily at around 0.7. In this period FAD risk has the\\nhighest values possible with low OLR (1.2–2.4 kg VS m�3 d�1) and\\nbetween low and medium OLRvar (5–20%). In other words, FAD\\nrisk does not increase further (unlike the FAS risk) because it has\\nreached its maximum value with the current values of OLR and\\nOLRvar. FAD risk would only increase, at these levels of FAS risk,\\nwith higher OLR and/or OLRvar. Around day 185, FAD risk drops\\nconsiderably for a few days, in line with OLRvar values, even\\nthough FAS risk is relatively high at this time. From day 270, the\\ntrend is for FAD risk to decrease in line with the FAS risk, and drop\\nmore sharply around day 320 due to another sharp decrease in\\nOLRvar values around the same time.\\n3.3. Operational parameters inﬂuence\\nAccording to the deﬁnition of the risk model, two main opera-\\ntional parameters inﬂuence the FAD risk: Qw and Qr. Qw inﬂu-\\nences the amount of solids going to the anaerobic digester, and\\nchanges the OLR accordingly. Qr has a direct effect on the amount\\nof solids in the activated sludge tanks, which is directly related to\\nthe F/M ratio on which the FAS risk depends. In other words, low\\nQr keeps solids concentration lower in the aerated tanks by not\\nreturning the activated sludge from the clariﬁers at high enough\\nrate, so the F/M is increased temporarily, thereby lowering the\\nFAS risk, and vice versa.\\nFor both Qr and Qw simulations the previously presented open-\\nloop case was used. For each Qr simulation Qw was kept at\\n300 m3 d�1, and for each Qw simulation Qr was kept at 1.0 times\\nthe inﬂow rate (Qin). Qw was tested from 100 to 700 m3 d�1 in\\n100 m3 d�1 steps, whereas Qr was tested from 0.25 times to 1.5\\ntimes Qin in 0.25 steps.\\n3.4. Effect of Qr\\nTable 2 summarises the average FAD risk, FAS risk, OLR and\\nOLRvar for each Qr. Table 2 shows how FAD risk increases from\\n0.412 for a Qr value of 0.25 times Qin to 0.571 for a Qr value of\\n1.0 times Qin. From this point, on average FAD risk remains con-\\nstant at 0.574 for higher Qr values. As noted previously, at low\\nQr, FAS risk is low as well, in accordance with FAD risk. At higher\\nQr the inverse effect takes place, and average FAD risk increases.\\nAverage OLRvar increases at the same rate that the average OLR de-\\ncreases as Qr increases. This trend can be explained by the fact that\\nlower values of OLR and similar values of OLR increments give a\\nhigher percentage of OLRvar.\\n3.5. Effect of Qw\\nTable 3 shows the average FAD risk, FAS risk, OLR and OLRvar\\nfor each Qw. When Qw increases, average FAD risk also increases\\nslightly at ﬁrst, from 0.548 to 0.572, but then descends to 0.432.\\nThe increase in average OLR explains the rise in average FAD risk\\nfor Qw from 100 to 200 m3 d�1. Afterwards, it descends to 0.432\\n(for Qw equal to 700 m3 d�1), given that FAS risk decreases drasti-\\ncally from 0.766 to 0.475 with the increase in Qw (from 200 to\\nFig. 4.

Regarding average OLRvar, it decreases in line with the in-\\ncrease in the average OLR, as in the previous case (i.e. Qr study),\\nalthough this time the effect is greater for the Qw of 100 m3 d�1,\\ngiven the low average OLR. Thus, for a given daily OLR oscillation\\nit is important not to have too low OLR, since OLRvar could in-\\ncrease the FAD risk.\\n3.6. Closed-loop control strategies\\nTwo closed-loop cases with automatic controllers involving\\nmanipulation of variables related to the risk model inputs were\\nused to test the model’s performance.\\nThe ﬁrst control strategy (CS1) involves the BSM2 default DO\\ncontroller (Nopens et al., 2008), which consists of a proportional-\\nintegral (PI) DO controller with a set point of 2 g O2 m�3 in reactor\\n4 by manipulating the overall oxygen transfer rate coefﬁcient, KLa.\\nFor reactors 3 and 5, the same KLa is applied with a gain of 1 and\\n0.5, respectively. CS1 also includes a TSS controller with a setpoint\\nof 4400 gTSS m�3 (3400 gTSS m�3 if T < 15 �C) mixed liquor sus-\\npended solids (MLSS) concentration, which manipulates Qw. This\\nCS shows the effect of controlling the solids inventory in the acti-\\nvated sludge process on the digester. The variability of Qw is also\\nreﬂected in the OLRvar value.\\nThe second control strategy (CS2) involves the same DO control-\\nler plus an ideal PI OLR controller which manipulates Qw using an\\nOLR setpoint of 1.75 kg VS m�3 d�1. The effect of such a controller\\non the FAD risk in this strategy is interesting.\\nFig. 5 shows the simulated results for CS1. The OLR range is in\\nthe same range as in the open-loop case. During the winter period\\n(days from 150 to 240 approximately), the general FAD risk trend is\\nsimilar to the open-loop case, although this time the manipulation\\nof Qw causes more peaks in OLRvar, which is also reﬂected in the\\npeaks appearing in the FAD risk proﬁle. Likewise, noticeable\\nchanges in the OLR proﬁle are reﬂected in FAD risk as well. For in-\\nstance, during the summer period (days from 0 to 50 and 320 to\\n364 approximately) the same effect as seen in Fig. 4 is present here\\n(i.e. the decrease in FAD risk linked to the decrease in OLR and OLR-\\nvar). As a result, keeping the solids inventory constant in the acti-\\nvated sludge tanks in fact causes more instability to the anaerobic\\ndigester in terms of FAD risk.\\nFig. 6 shows the proﬁle of the risk model input variables for CS2\\ntogether with the FAD risk. It can be clearly seen how the OLR con-\\ntroller drastically reduces OLRvar, the effect of which can also be\\nappreciated in the OLR since oscillations have almost disappeared.\\nThis low OLRvar causes the FAD risk to stabilise around 0.45 even\\nthough FAS risk is high, especially during the winter and early\\nspring period. The only exception to this almost constant FAD risk\\nis during the summer period, with its low MLSS concentration\\nassociated with the summer season, which is also the reason for\\nthe low FAS risk.\\nTable 4 shows the benchmark evaluation criteria (i.e. EQI, OCI)\\ntogether with average time at high FAD risk (>0.8) and average\\nFAD risk for the three cases presented (i.e. open-loop, CS1 and CS2).\\nWhile the highest FAD risk corresponds to the open-loop case,\\nthe lowest FAD risk corresponds to CS2 since the OLR controller\\nregulates the OLR to a safe setpoint (1.75 kg VS m�3 d�1). The aver-\\nage time at high FAD risk is higher for CS1 due to the control of the\\nMLSS in the activated sludge. For example, whenever MLSS is high\\nthe automatic controller increases Qw, which increases the feed\\nOLR to the anaerobic digester. Efﬂuent quality is slightly worse\\nfor CS2 than for open-loop and CS1 due to the fact that the OLR\\ncontrol is performed regardless of the MLSS concentration in the\\nsludge system. Thus MLSS concentration in the activated sludge\\ntanks could be lower than the concentration required to achieve\\noptimal treatment efﬁciency. Operational cost is lower for CS2\\ndue to the low OLRvar linked to low Qw variations, as can be seen\\nin the OLRvar proﬁles in Figs. 5 and 6. Moreover, OLR is slightly\\nhigher in CS2 than in CS1, leading to higher methane production\\nTable 3\\nAverage FAD risk, FAS risk, OLR and OLRvar for each Qw.\\nQw (m3 d�1)\\n100\\n200\\n300\\n400\\n500\\n600\\n700\\nav.

As is evident, there is\\na trade-off between the optimal performance in the activated\\nsludge and anaerobic digester regarding efﬂuent quality and costs.\\nThe results of the risk model emphasise the need for plant-wide\\nsupervisory control strategies to minimise trade-off effects, which\\nat the same time is an aim for sustainable sludge and wastewater\\ntreatment.\\n4. Discussion\\nRecent research advances in population dynamics and mecha-\\nnistic modelling provide valuable knowledge for future develop-\\nment\\nof\\na\\ngeneral\\ndeterministic\\nmodel\\nof\\nthe\\nﬁlamentous\\nbacteria and related operational problems of microbiological ori-\\ngin. Nevertheless, a complete general mechanistic model is yet to\\nbe determined. Thus, a risk model provides a complementary tool\\nwhich can be applied to any general or speciﬁc models.\\nRegarding the results of the risk model, it is important to high-\\nlight that the aim is not to diagnose operational problems of micro-\\nbiological origin with absolute certainty but to quantify whether\\nthe simulated control strategies bring about a severe risk for lead-\\ning the system towards a situation with operational problems of\\nmicrobiological origin. In order to calculate the evaluation indices\\nit was necessary to quantify the risk index initially with a scope to\\nimprove later with more mechanistic factors included. For this rea-\\nson, a threshold value of 0.8 was ﬁxed to indicate severe risk of\\noperational foaming problems of microbiological origin.\\nValidation is still an open question since it is difﬁcult even in\\nthe case of the risk model used in this research. A validation of\\nthe risk model based on real data from a pilot plant or a full-scale\\nWWTP is very difﬁcult due to the fact that the model is giving the\\nrisk of a particular operational problem of microbiological origin\\nbut this risk is seldom recorded in real plants (common monitoring\\nprograms do not even register the occurrence of those problems).\\nMoreover, the risk model is not developed to be applied in full-\\nscale facilities directly by itself but to complement dynamic simu-\\nlations when comparing operational procedures and control\\nstrategies.\\nA sensitivity analysis can enhance the customization of the risk\\nmodel offering the possibility to identify the most sensitive vari-\\nables. Afterwards, a customization process based on those vari-\\nables could provide a more reliable risk model for adaptation to\\nspeciﬁc anaerobic digestion systems. Performing a detailed and\\ncomplete sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the risk assess-\\nment model, not only to study the effect of the fuzzy parameters\\n(limits, ranges and shape of membership functions) but also to\\nunderstand and analyse the knowledge embodied in the decision\\nmatrices and to highlight the relevance and linearity of the vari-\\nables, is high on our priority list of future work.\\n5. Conclusions\\nThe risk model for anaerobic digestion foaming together with a\\nrisk model for problems related to activated sludge systems pro-\\nvide an overall approach for the plant-wide evaluation of microbi-\\nology-related problems, allowing model users to have a complete\\nset of criteria and thereby avoid biased evaluations of the simula-\\ntion results.\\nThis tool is complementary to existing criteria related to re-\\nmoval efﬁciencies and to operational costs, meaning that new con-\\nclusions can be drawn from the simulation evaluation process\\nwhen microbiology-related problems are included. Some simu-\\nlated control strategies which can have a positive impact in terms\\nof environmental and/or economic criteria may prove to be not\\nsuitable when anaerobic digester performance is evaluated.\\nAcknowledgements\\nMany thanks to Dr. Ulf Jeppsson from the University of Lund\\n(Sweden) for providing his implementation of BSM2 in Matlab\\n(MathWorks Inc.).

Anaerobic digestion is a process commonly used to remove carbon, and can\\nact on metal availability (e.g., solubility or oxidation state). The present study aimed to evaluate the\\ninﬂuence of anaerobic digestion on total Zn and Cu contents, and their chemical fractioning due to the\\nbiodegradation of the efﬂuent over different hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The sequential extraction\\nprotocol proposed by the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR), plus two additional fractions, was the\\nmethod chosen for this study of Cu and Zn distribution evaluation in swine wastewater. The Zn and Cu\\nconcentrations in raw swine manure were 63.58 � 27.72 mg L�1 and 8.98 � 3.99 mg L�1, respectively. The\\nmetal retention capacity of the bioreactor decreased when the HRT was reduced from 17.86 d to 5.32 d.\\nAnaerobic digestion had a direct inﬂuence on zinc and copper distribution when raw manure (RM) and\\ndigested manure (DM) were compared. The reducible fraction showed a reduction of between 3.17% and\\n7.84% for Zn and between 2.52% and 11.92% for Cu when DM was compared with RM. However, the metal\\nconcentration increased in the oxidizable fraction of DM, viz. from 3.01% to 10.64% for Zn and from 4.49%\\nto 16.71% for Cu, thus demonstrating the effect of anaerobic conditions on metal availability.\\n� 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\\nThe main environmental impacts caused by intensive swine\\nproduction are due to the large volume of concentrated wastewater\\napplied to the soil without a good agronomic management practice.\\nThe manure composition may change according to the animal\\ngrowth phase and diet. These waste matters are rich in organic\\nmatter, nutrients and metals that have high pollution potential for\\nwater, air and soil (Steinmetz et al., 2009).\\nAnaerobic digestion is an important and effective treatment\\nalternative for organic matter (mainly biodegradable matter) and\\nreduces greenhouse gas emission (Kunz et al., 2009; Tauseef et al.,\\n2013; Zaman, 2013). Metal species that are present in manure\\ncannot be removed in the same way as organic carbon and will be\\npresent in the digestate and can accumulate in the soil when used\\nas a biofertilizer (Achiba et al., 2010; Vries et al., 2012; Montoneri\\net al., 2014).\\nThe availability of metals for microbial uptake and growth\\ndepends on the metal speciation, which is governed by the reactor\\nconditions (e.g., pH, temperature, hydraulic retention time (HRT)\\nand redox potential). The metal concentration and distribution are\\ndependent on the chemical processes inside the reactor, such as\\nprecipitation and complexation and can affect the biochemical\\nreactions (Aquino and Stuckey, 2008; Mudhoo and Kumar, 2013).\\nChanges in the biodigester parameters can signiﬁcantly affect\\nthe initial stages of anaerobic digestion, mainly hydrolysis, by\\naltering the characteristics of the generated products from the\\nanaerobic digestion that can affect the metal distribution in the\\ndigestate (Evans and Furlong, 2011).\\nSeveral metals are found in swine manure, such as aluminum,\\niron, manganese, zinc and copper, reaching different concentra-\\ntions in the swine wastewater. Among these metals, copper (Cu)\\nand zinc (Zn) are found in higher concentrations, up to 15 mg L�1\\nand 40 mg L�1, respectively, due to their use in swine diet\\n(Steinmetz et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2010). Zn is an important\\ncomponent of enzymes, e.g., hydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase\\n* Corresponding author. Tel.: þ55 49 34410481.\\nE-mail addresses: andrec.doamaral@gmail.com (A.

Cu is related to the increment\\nin the body’s defense against oxidative stress because it is neces-\\nsary for hemoglobin synthesis, and it also plays an important role in\\nthe animal immune system (Shao et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2012).\\nAssessment of the behavior of metals present in complex\\nmatrices such as swine wastewater could be a very important tool\\nto avoid losses in biogas generation efﬁciency. It has been shown\\nthat the determination of total metal content is not enough to\\nindicate its bioavailability, mobility and toxicity (Amir et al., 2005).\\nIn fact, the bioavailability and toxicity of metals are more often\\ndependent on the chemical form of the metals (He et al., 2009). The\\nmobility and bioavailability of Cu and Zn can provide important\\ninformation for the understanding of microorganism inhibition\\nmechanisms in anaerobic digestion (Guillén et al., 2010). An un-\\nderstanding of the distribution of metals in swine manure is\\nnecessary to predict and avoid negative effects on the anaerobic\\ndigestion process and to help choose the best management prac-\\ntices for the digestate (Wang et al., 2005).\\nSeveral sequential chemical speciation schemes have been\\napplied; however, the results obtained by these different tech-\\nniques were not comparable. This led the Community Bureau of\\nReference (BCR) to develop a three-step protocol of sequential\\nchemical extraction (Ure et al., 1993) to standardize and harmonize\\nthe results. The protocol divides the metals into different phases,\\nviz. exchangeable or bound to carbonates, reducible (bound hy-\\ndrated oxides of Fe and Mn) and oxidized (linked to organic matter\\nand sulﬁde).\\nThe original BCR extraction protocol was developed for dry\\nsediments; however, this causes oxidation of the samples, which\\ncan change the original metal speciation (Bordas and Bourg, 1998).\\nWhen the extraction procedure is performed in wet samples to\\nmaintain the original partitioning, the water-soluble fraction is\\nconsidered the supernatant water (Buykx et al., 2000). As an in-\\nternal check on the procedure, it is also recommended that the\\nresidue from the organic fraction be digested and the total amount\\nof metal extracted (i.e., sum of Step 1 þ Step 2 þ Step 3 þ Step\\n4 þ Residue) and compared with the values obtained from the total\\nmetal analysis (Sutherland, 2010).\\nConsidering these facts, the present study aimed to evaluate the\\ninﬂuence of anaerobic digestion on total Zn and Cu contents as well\\nas the effect of their chemical fractioning on the digestate through\\nchanges in the hydraulic retention time using the BCR sequential\\nextraction protocol plus two additional fractions.\\n2. Material and methods\\n2.1.

Biodigester\\nA 10 m3 ﬁberglass upﬂow biodigester with an internal heating\\nsystem to keep the biomass temperature at a constant 36 (�2) �C\\nwas used in this study (Fig. 1). The bioreactor was fed according to\\nthe desired ﬂow rate (Table 1). A recirculation system was turned\\non twice a day for 2 min to prevent biomass clogging. Sludge dis-\\ncharges of 2% (v sludge/v inﬂuent) were performed during all of the\\nexperiments. The biodigester inﬂuent and efﬂuent samples were\\ncollected, representing raw manure (RM) and digested manure\\n(DM), respectively. Fig. 1\\n2.3. Biodigester HRT changes\\nThe study was divided into three phases by increasing the ﬂow\\nrate in the biodigester (Table 1). The bioreactor was fed intermit-\\ntently using a pump submerged in HT. The feeding pump was\\nactivated for 3.2 min every 2 h (23.34 L h�1) during phase 1, for\\n3.2 min every hour (55.00 L h�1) during phase 2 and for 4.8 min\\neach hour (78.33 L h�1) during phase 3. Table 1\\n2.4. Total Cu and Zn sequential extraction and quantiﬁcation\\nThe total metal concentration was obtained by using a nitric\\nacid/hydrogen peroxide mixture by the following method. First,\\n5 mL of concentrated HNO3 was added to 5 mL of the sample, and\\nthe mixture was then heated under reﬂux for 5 h. After cooling,\\n500 mL of H2O2 30% (v/v) was added and the solution was heated\\nagain under reﬂux for 1 h, or until the solution became transparent.\\nFinally, the solution was cooled and quantitatively transferred to\\ngraduated polypropylene vials and diluted to 25 mL using puriﬁed\\nwater (Steinmetz et al., 2009).\\nThe sequential extraction scheme developed by BCR (Ure et al.,\\n1993) plus two additional fractions was conducted as shown in\\nFig. 2.

Total Cu and Zn concentration\\nThe ﬁrst purpose of this study was to determine and understand\\nthe behavior of the metals when subjected to biodigestion. The Cu\\nand Zn total concentrations found in swine manure before and after\\ntreatment under the three HRT conditions are shown in Table 2. To\\nfacilitate comparison with Brazilian and international literature and\\nregulations, the concentrations of the metals in RM and DM were\\npresented in two forms: (a) dry matter (mg.g�1) and (b) liquid\\nmanure (mg L�1). Table 2\\nDuring phase 1 (HRT e 17.86 d) and phase 2 (HRT e 7.57 d), the\\nbioreactor exhibited the capacity to retain Zn and Cu in anaerobic\\nsludge, as evidenced by higher RM and lower DM concentrations\\n(Table 2). This can be attributed to a reaction between the reduced\\nsulfur species (e.g., H2S) produced in anaerobic digestion with\\ncopper and zinc compounds, forming highly insoluble copper and\\nzinc sulﬁdes (Vivan et al., 2010; Gonzalez-Gil et al., 2012; Gus-\\ntavsson et al., 2013). The H2S concentration in biogas was\\n420 � 245 mL m�3, during this study. The reduction of sulfur\\ncompounds to H2S in an anaerobic environment occurs in\\nFig. 2.

In phase 3\\n(5.32 d), DM exhibited a higher concentration of metals than RM.\\nThis was due to an increased ﬂow rate, generating greater internal\\nagitation of biomass in the digester and providing the dragging of\\nsolids.\\nNo signiﬁcant difference was found between the concentrations\\nof total solids during phase 1 (6.03 g L�1 � 0.60) and phase 2\\n(6.46 g L�1 � 0.56). Phase 3 showed an increase of total solids\\nconcentration in DM (10.12 g L�1 � 1.26). This increase was sig-\\nniﬁcant when compared to either phase 1 (p ¼ 0.0051) or phase 2\\n(p ¼ 0.0308).\\nBased on Cu and Zn concentrations expressed in mg L�1 in\\nTable 2, there were signiﬁcant differences between the concen-\\ntrations of Zn in RM during phases 1 and 2 (p ¼ 0.0036), 1 and 3\\n(p < 0.0001) and 2 and 3 (p ¼ 0.0002). With regard to the Zn\\nconcentrations in DM, there were signiﬁcant differences between\\nphases 1 and 2 (p ¼ 0.0215) and 1 and 3 (p ¼ 0.0002). The Cu\\nconcentrations in RM also presented signiﬁcant differences be-\\ntween phases 1 and 2 (p ¼ 0.0015),1 and 3 (p < 0.0001) and 2 and 3\\n(p ¼ 0.0085). For DM, signiﬁcant Cu concentration differences\\noccurred between phases 1 and 2 (p ¼ 0.0025) and 1 and 3\\n(p < 0.0001).\\nThese differences in metal concentrations in RM during the\\nthree phases of the study can be attributed mainly to changes in the\\ncomposition of swine food during the various stages of animal\\ngrowth (Gopalan et al., 2013). The metal concentration can also be\\ninﬂuenced by variation in animal numbers in different stages of\\nproduction during the study. Changes in the volume of generated\\nefﬂuent can be attributed to differences in swine water consump-\\ntion, cleaning of the facilities and water leakage that cause changes\\nin the efﬂuent metal concentration (Steinmetz et al., 2009).\\nChanges in storage conditions before the anaerobic treatment can\\nalso cause differences in the concentrations of Cu and Zn present in\\nswine manure (Popovic and Jensen, 2012).\\nIt is important to understand the regulations regarding land\\napplication when considering the total metal concentration in the\\ndigestate.\\nThe Brazilian resolution CONAMA 375 (2006) establishes\\ncriteria for the use of sewage sludge generated at the sewage\\ntreatment plant as soil conditioner for agriculture, where the limits\\nfor Zn and Cu are 2.8 mg g�1 and 1.5 mg g�1, respectively. During\\nthe three phases of the study, the Cu concentration was below the\\nlimit established by this resolution; however, the Zn concentration\\n(Table 2) was above this limit (22%e135%). The European Union\\nrecommends maximum levels for metals in anaerobically digested\\nsludge for land application. The maximum values for Zn and Cu are\\n4.00 mg g�1 and 1.75 mg g�1, respectively (Nordber, 2010). The\\nvalues found for Zn in this study (Table 2) exceed the limits\\nestablished by this guideline by 65% and 41% in phases 1 and 2,\\nrespectively. The zinc concentration in phase 3 and the copper\\nconcentration during all phases were lower than the limits previ-\\nously mentioned. The United States Environmental Protection\\nAgency (EPA) proposed limits to the metal concentration in bio-\\nsolids applied on land, with Zn and Cu concentration limits of\\n7.50 mg g�1 and 4.30 mg g�1, respectively (EPA, 2004). The metal\\nconcentrations contained in swine wastewater were lower than the\\nlimits imposed by this legislation, except during phase 3 for DM,\\nwhen Zn surpassed the limit by only 0.70%.\\n3.1.2. Metal distribution and HRT\\nAfter studying the total metal concentrations in raw and\\ndigested manure, an evaluation was made of the zinc (Fig. 3a) and\\ncopper (Fig. 3b) distribution in different chemical fractions of RM\\nand DM using the procedure described in Fig. 2. Fig. 3\\nThe Water Soluble Fraction (WSF) is mainly composed of free\\nmetal ions and complexed ions with soluble organic material (Ure\\nand Davidson, 2001). Free metal ions in swine manure can be\\nadsorbed by the biomass present in the digester. Once adsorbed,\\nmetals are displaced to the oxidizable fraction (Gerardi, 2003). Due\\nto the presence of H2S inside the biodigester, Cu and Zn can pre-\\ncipitate as sulﬁdes (Kaﬂe and Kim, 2013), which is another reason\\nfor the low metal concentration in WSF. With regard to Zn, this\\nfraction was negligible in RM and DM. In phase 2, Cu was present at\\n8.20% in RM, but after anaerobic digestion was reduced to 2.15%.\\nThe Acid Extractable/Exchangeable Fraction (AEEF) includes\\nmetals weakly adsorbed to the surface of solids present in swine\\nmanure as a result of weak electrostatic interactions. These metals\\nare often released by ionic exchange processes and may be co-\\nprecipitated as carbonates or bicarbonates. Carbonates can be an\\nimportant adsorbent for many trace metals, this fraction being\\ndirectly related to the alkalinity in the biodigester (Filgueiras et al.,\\n2002). The AEEF fraction remained nearly constant during the\\nanaerobic digestion. During phases 1 and 2 it was reduced by 0.85%\\nand 1.75% (Zn) and by 0.56% and 0.49% (Cu), respectively, whereas\\nin phase 3 it increased by 0.89% (Zn) and 0.20% (Cu), comparing RM\\nand DM.\\nThe reducible fraction (RF) represents the fraction where metals\\nare bonded to iron and manganese hydrated oxides (Filgueiras\\net al., 2002). This fraction decreases between RM and DM and is\\nthermodynamically unstable under strictly anaerobic conditions\\n(P-RedOx < �200 mV), which causes fraction dissolution after\\npassing through the biodigester (Marin et al., 1997). During phases\\n1, 2 and 3, the Zn concentration in the RF decreased by 6.40%, 7.84%\\nand 3.17%, respectively, when comparing RM and DM. Copper had\\nsimilar characteristics, decreasing by 11.92% in phase 1 and by only\\n2.52% in phase 3. A smaller inﬂuence of anaerobic digestion can be\\nobserved in phase 3, which corresponds to the shortest HRT\\n(Table 1). The subsequent steps of the anaerobic digestion process\\nare directly related to HRT. The reduction of HRT has signiﬁcant\\nFig. 3. a) Zinc distribution in ﬁve different chemical speciation during three phases, in raw manure (RM) and digested manure (DM). b) Copper distribution in ﬁve different chemical\\nspeciation during three phases, in raw manure (RM) and digested manure (DM).\\nA. Cestonaro do Amaral et al. / Journal of Environmental Management 141 (2014) 132e137\\n135\\nimpacts on the initial steps of anaerobic digestion and is directly\\nrelated to substrate availability and biodegradability (Deublein and\\nSteinhauser, 2008; Kim et al., 2012).\\nThe oxidizable fraction (OF) comprises the metals linked to\\norganic matter and/or a sulﬁde. With the dissolution of the frac-\\ntions previously discussed, the metallic ions are precipitated as\\nsulﬁdes (Ks CuS ¼ 8.0 � 10�37 and Ks ZnS ¼ 1.2 � 10�23) in anaerobic\\nenvironments and under high H2S concentration conditions (Peu\\net al., 2012).\\nThe Zn concentration (mg L�1) for RM and DM in OF were 48.94\\nand 40.00 (phase 1), 29.64 and 29.25 (phase 2) and 28.96 and 31.61\\n(phase 3). The Cu concentration (mg L�1) for RM and DM in OF were\\n7.78 and 7.96 (phase 1), 5.04 and 4.63 (phase 2) and 4.35 and 4.76\\n(phase 3). There was an increase of 7.60% (Zn) and 16.71% (Cu) in\\nphase 1, 10.64% (Zn) and 6.93% (Cu) in phase 2 and 3.01% (Zn) and\\n4.49% (Cu) in phase 3. Artola et al. (2000) proposed that the\\nanaerobic biomass has a high afﬁnity for metals, particularly Cu.\\nThis fact can also be observed in Fig. 3b, where the largest portion\\nof the metals is found in the oxidizable fraction, thus demon-\\nstrating high afﬁnity. Theis and Hayes (1978) showed that anaer-\\nobic conditions (redox potential around �300 mV and neutral pH)\\nfavor the formation of carbonates and the precipitation of sulﬁdes.\\nHowever, they also cause an increase in the oxidizable fraction\\n(Fig. 3), which indicates that precipitation in the form of sulﬁdes\\nprevailed during this study once the fraction containing the car-\\nbonates was insigniﬁcant.\\nThe metal residual fraction (MRF) contains residual metals,\\nespecially primary and secondary minerals (Filgueiras et al., 2002).\\nWe studied swine wastewater before and after anaerobic bio-\\ndigestion, using the sequential chemical speciation method as\\nproposed by Stover et al. (1976) and modiﬁed by McGrath and\\nCegarra (1992) and Marcato et al. (2009). The results described by\\nthese authors are very different from those obtained during the\\npresent study. The Cu concentration was found to be highest in the\\noxidizable fraction and decreased after anaerobic digestion as a\\nresult of an increase in the carbonate fraction. However, Zn was\\nfound mainly in the carbonate fraction for both raw and digested\\nmanure, while both metals have signiﬁcantly increased concen-\\ntrations in the residual fraction after anaerobically reaching levels\\nnear 25%.\\nThe internal procedure control on the results of the BCR\\nsequential extraction was performed by comparing the sum of the\\nﬁve fractions with the total concentration of metals from the\\ndigestion procedure (Rauret et al., 1999). The sum of the ﬁve steps\\nwas in good agreement with the total metal concentration, with\\nsatisfactory recoveries, viz. 87.74%e99.19% for Zn and 81.60%e\\n104.73% for Cu. This indicates that the present BCR protocol with\\ntwo additional fractions is reliable (Chen et al., 2008).\\n3.2. The biodigester and its environmental implications\\nThe trace elements contained in WSF are relatively labile and\\nthus have a high bioavailable potential for anaerobic microorgan-\\nisms. These free and complexed ion species and ions complexed\\nwith soluble organic matter and other constituents, constitute the\\nmost mobile and potentially the most available metal and metalloid\\nspecies.\\nAEEF contains metals that are precipitated or co-precipitated\\nwith carbonate and weakly adsorbed metals retained on the sur-\\nface of solids by weak electrostatic interactions. The carbonate form\\nand adsorbed metals are liable to change with environmental\\nconditions (Filgueiras et al., 2002).\\nIn RF, the metals are bonded to iron and manganese hydrated\\noxides. This fraction presents greater mobility because the metals\\nassociated with this fraction are thermodynamically unstable. The\\nreduction of Fe(III) and Mn(IV) under anoxic conditions and their\\nsubsequent dissolution could release adsorbed trace metals. The\\ndissolution of RF in biodigester bulk is due to negative values of the\\nredox potential.\\nWhen DM or RM is applied to the soil, the WSF, AEEF and RF can\\nbe easily absorbed by organisms present in the environment. Thus,\\nthese fractions can be identiﬁed as having a direct environmental\\neffect (Chen et al., 2008).\\nOF is only mobilized in oxidizing conditions, being transformed\\ninto WSF, AEEF and RF. However, the ecotoxic potential of should\\nnot be ignored. Depending on the characteristics of the soil in\\nwhich it is applied, OF can be identiﬁed as a fraction with pollution\\npotential (Yao et al., 2010). OF dominates trace metal distribution in\\nanaerobic\\nenvironments,\\nespecially\\nthrough\\nthe\\npresence\\nof\\nmetallic sulﬁdes that are not susceptible to biodigestion, as they do\\nnot interact with microorganisms (Guo et al., 2012).\\nFraction MRF, viz. metals bound to stable inorganic structures, is\\ninert to organisms and is identiﬁed as a stable fraction (Fuentes\\net al., 2008). The metals are not expected to be found in solutions\\nin a reasonable time under the regular conditions found in natural\\nsystems (Lasheen and Ammar, 2009).\\n4. Conclusion\\nThe highest concentrations of the two metals were bound to the\\noxidizable fraction in both raw (RM) and digested manure (DM).\\nThe process of anaerobic digestion changed the distributions of Zn\\nand Cu in phase 1(HRT e 17.86 d) and phase 2 (HRT e 7.57 d). There\\nwas a minor inﬂuence on the distribution of Zn and Cu in RM and\\nDM during phase 3 (HRT e 5.32 d). The metal concentrations in the\\nfractions that were more bioavailable to the environment were\\nalways smaller than the oxidizable fraction. This shows that most\\nmetals are not readily bioavailable to anaerobic microorganisms, or\\nduring land application when digestate is used as an organic\\nfertilizer.\\nThe information derived from the present study can be used to\\nassess the potential mobility or bioavailability of these metals in the\\nbiodigester, and to provide evidence for the suitability and feasi-\\nbility of the digested swine manure for agronomic applications.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis study had ﬁnancial support from Coordenação de Aper-\\nfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, Brazil and ITAIPU\\nBinacional.\\nReferences\\nAchiba, B.W., Lakhdar, A., Gabteni, N., Laing, G.D., Verloo, M., Boeckx, P., Van\\nCleemput, O., Jedidi, N., Gallali, T., 2010.
